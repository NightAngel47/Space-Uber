Compressed infinitely by the massive gravity of the wormhole until the pressure is too much to bear. Just as fast as the ship had entered the wormhole it comes right back out, flung into the far reaches of space. To the surprise of no one, the ship sustained minor damage from breaking the laws of physics. But, to the surprise of everyone, it seems that you are now much closer to your destination.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"Sent":["^As you approach the umbral blot alarms start blaring.

However, rather than being completely swallowed, the ship only skirts along the event horizon before managing to gain enough momentum to break free. Unfortunately, the momentum that freed the ship also caused it to fly back to where it came from. Overall, the little excursion with the wormhole damaged the ship and has only served to lengthen the journey ahead.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Pranked":["^As you approach the umbral blot alarms start blaring.

You watch as the ship and its inhabitants start to spaghettify and wonder if such warped cargo would still reach market price. In a last-ditch effort, you rout all power towards the engines and only barely manage to escape the event horizon. The ship has been mangled by the wormhole and suffered major damage.

But, that time never came. The ship was spat out of the wormhole just as fast as it had been swallowed. However, it wasn’t for nothing.
