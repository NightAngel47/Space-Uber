{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^Kellis has instructed you and your crew to travel to a currently unnamed planet within the sector of space quaintly titled “The Galactic Graveyard”. The job itself consists of assisting the archaeologists present in their efforts to uncover anything Kellis would deem worthwhile. The instructions also mention that should you or your crew find anything of interest that it be reported immediately.","\n","^Hushed whispers fly freely amongst your crew when they are informed of the destination. You pay them little mind, most of it consists of nothing more than superstitious rambling, after all. However, the notion that you are going to be helping with “corporate grave-robbing” is a bit of a stretch. The planet you are going to has no official name or recorded history, as such anything found on or within said planet is the rightful property of Kellis. Although you grace your crew with this tidbit of information, it seems to do little to dissuade their concerns.","\n","done",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
