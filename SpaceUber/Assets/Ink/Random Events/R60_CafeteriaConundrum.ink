It started like any other meal served at the mess hall. Crew lining up for whatever slop is on the menu, waiting impatiently for their turn. That’s when push comes to shove, which soon escalates into an all out foodfight. An extraordinary amount of food now decorates the walls. This is not something that you can allow to occur again.

== Ration ==
Meals become little more than required nutrients. Each crew member gets enough food to survive and no more. This doesn’t bode well, but they understand the foodfight depleted supply reserves.
->DONE
== Punish ==
You instruct the instigators to stand front and center in front of the mess hall camera. They do so reluctantly, and you explain that these crew are the ones that started the incident. The rest of the crew assault them with any food that hadn’t yet hit the walls. Although the food reserves have been lowered the crew are content with giving the instigators their just desserts.
