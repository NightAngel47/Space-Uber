You receive a message from medbay, finding Ripley sitting next to a severely injured crew member. She looks towards you, "Ah, I'm glad you could make it. This man would like to make a request of you." The man directs his attention towards your camera. He explains that although you have the means to save his life, he simply wishes to pass on. He promises that he will donate his personal wealth to the ship should you agree. Ripley seems to be having a hard time with this conundrum. She looks to you, exhaustion evident in her gaze. "While I understand where he's coming from, my job is to save people, <i>not</i> let them die..." 
+[Agree to the Request]->Approve
+[Insist Treatment]->Insist

== Approve ==
The man smiles, thanking both you and Ripley. She doesn't even try to hide the fact that she is incredibly uncomfortable with the outcome. The man passes away a short while later, and true to his word, he left all his money for the ship. Before you disconnect from the cameras you see Ripley zip up the deceased man in a body bag. She lets out a shaky sigh and stares off into the distance.
->DONE
== Insist ==
You tell Ripley to administer the treatment. The man is visibly upset, but before he can make a fuss Ripley injects something into his IV drip and he falls unconscious rather quickly. She looks at you, and you see a slight twitch around the corners of her mouth. Did she just smile? Ripley tells you that the treatment will take a short while, but he will be better soon. She thanks you for your help.
