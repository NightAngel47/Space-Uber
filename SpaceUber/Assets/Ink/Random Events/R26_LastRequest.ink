You receive a message from Medbay. You arrive to find Ripley sitting next to a severely injured crew member in a bed. She looks towards you, “Ah, I’m glad you could make it. This man would like to make a request of you.” You listen as the man explains his request. He explains that although you have the necessary means to save his life, he simply wishes to pass on. He promises that he will donate his personal wealth to the ship should you agree. Ripley seems to be having a hard time with this conundrum. She understands where the man is coming from, but still feels compelled to try and save him. She looks at you with exhausted eyes. It’s time to make a choice.
+[Agree to the Request]->Approve
+[Insist Treatment]->Insist

== Approve ==
The man smiles, thanking both you and Ripley, who doesn’t even try to hide the fact that she is incredibly uncomfortable with the outcome. The man passed away a short while later, and true to his word, he left all his money for the ship. You catch a glimpse into the Medbay and see Ripley zip up the deceased man in a body bag. She lets out a shaky sigh and stares off into the distance.
->DONE
== Insist ==
You tell Ripley to administer the treatment. The man is visibly upset, but before he can make a fuss Ripley injects something into his IV drip and he falls unconscious rather quickly. She looks at you, and you see a slight twitch around the corners of her mouth. Did she just smile? Ripley tells you that the treatment will take a short while, but he will be better soon. She thanks you for your help with the situation.
