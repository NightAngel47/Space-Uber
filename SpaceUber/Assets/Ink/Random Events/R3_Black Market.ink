Kuon approaches your terminal, "Boss. We have a signal ping. Universal code transmition. Less than a thousand kilometers off the flight plan. We're seeing 'bartering,' 'value,' and 'discretion.'" He slows down, as if gauging your reaction, "This sounds like a boon. Given the legality of their trade, prices should be good for us. I suggest we follow up.”

-> Black_Market

== Black_Market ==
Accepting his suggestion, you divert your flight plan into the shadow of a nearby gas giant. You coast into a tower-shaped space station covered in radio antennas and finding ample room in its hangar. A broker, wrapped in a patchwork of several suits, cuff-links, and masks, boards your ship. They welcome you to the black market, and offer you their wares. Kuon scoffs at the broker. If he's having second thoughts he's reluctant to mention them.

You decide that none of the black market's options are worth the money or ire from local authorities.

== Flashclones ==
The clones you purchased are entirely functional as crewmates, having sufficient brain plasticity to be trained to do any task within the week. The broker, however, supplied you with no receipt of whose likeness the clones were modeled after. Clone production without consent of the template could easily catch you on an IP lawsuit. Keeping these new crew members off the books is ideal.
->END

==Nuclear_Weapons ==
Banned and re-banned for combat use every decade, nuclear weapons have somehow remained a mainstay in ship-to-ship combat for the duration of the space age. While highly effective, the launchers now attached to your ship are also highly illegal. To avoid infracting upon the Genora Conventions, you're warned to use them sparingly.
-> END

== Rations ==
Several metal shipping containers full of plastic-wrapped rations are loaded onto your ship. Each plastic bag contains one nutritious meal for one person and has "DISASTER RELIEF" emblazoned across it. The broker assures you that these were bought from a surplus, but they're being fenced here for a reason.
