== Brave ==
You instruct the crew to chart a course through the storm. While they wish you were joking, they do as you ask. The ship manages to get through a large portion of the cloud without problems, but the storm is growing more active. Bolts of energy start to assault the ship as it manages to slip out of the cloud. Although the hull has been damaged the energy bolts managed to charge the surplus power units. The crew ask that they never do that again.

== Way ==
The ship changes course to find a way around the storm. It takes some time, but you manage to get around the looming cloud unscathed. The crew have depleted some of the food stores, but are thankful for not having to face the wrath of the cosmos.
