A warm and soothing light begins to bathe the ship, initially no source is found. However, soon the crew have gathered in the main deck. Surrounding a floating ball of light no bigger than a person. The first to approach is Lanri, who reaches her hand into the orb without hesitation. “I can't believe it… to think I'd actually get the chance to see one in my lifetime. For the longest time, these things were only thought to be a theoretical anomaly. Because their existence has only been passed through word of mouth they've been known simply as 'Radiance'. Incredible…” The rest of the crew follow suit, drawing closer to the Radiance and basking in the inviting warmth. Lanri directs her attention towards you, “You know, we can move this to another spot on the ship. Who knows what benefits we might gain from it, at least while it lasts? I, for one, am eager to find out.” Where should you put the Radiance?","\n","ev","str","^Shine on Hydroponics","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Shine on Main Deck","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":4},"ev","str","^Shine on Solar Panels","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":4},{"c-0":[{"->":"Hydro"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":[{"->":"Deck"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":[{"->":"Solar"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Hydro":["^You decide to move the Radiance to Hydroponics.
