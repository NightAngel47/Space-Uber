You receive an alert that a rogue program has infiltrated the ship's systems through the security terminal. You contact Kuon to figure out what happened. He sheepishly explains, "I received a message that I had won a grand prize, but when I went to claim it the terminal froze up.". It appears that cyber-security is not one of his fortes. Nonetheless, you need to sort this out.

== Purge ==
You draw power from the ship's reserves in order to scour it's systems for the virus. Soon enough, you find what you're looking for and take great pleasure in eradicating it. You inform Kuon to tell you first if he wins any more free vacations before continuing with your journey. He gives a silent nod, too embarassed to speak.
->DONE
== Protect ==
You enact a firewall protocol to protect the most sensitive systems from the virus. Unfortunately, because it entered through the security terminal the virus tears through the security system. You ask that Kuon ignore any message like that in the future. He gives a silent nod, too embarassed to speak.
