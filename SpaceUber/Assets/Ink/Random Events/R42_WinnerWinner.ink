You receive an alert that a rogue program has infiltrated the ship's systems through the security terminal. You contact Kuon to figure out what happened and he explains, “I received a message that I had won a wonderful prize, but when I went to claim it the terminal froze up.”. It appears that cyber-security is not one of his fortes. Nonetheless, you need to sort this out.

== Purge ==
You draw power from the ship's reserves in order to scour it's systems for the virus. Soon enough, you find what you're looking for and take great pleasure in eradicating it. You inform Kuon to let you know if he receives any more messages of a similar nature before continuing with your journey.
->DONE
== Protect ==
You enact a firewall protocol to protect the most sensitive systems from the virus. Unfortunately, because it entered through the security terminal it ends up damaging the security system. You ask that Kuon ignore any message like that in the future.
