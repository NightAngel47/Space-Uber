 Doctor Lormay calls you, calm despite worried voices in the background, "It seems that one of the crew members has been misusing a recreational drug. He was found in the bunks suffering an overdose. He might not survive the following hours. I am asking for permission to administer some Conaxel to help stabilize him."
 Pausing, she lets out a brief sigh, "I can understand if you refuse. Our stock of Conaxel is minuscule; refilling it will cost some credits. While it would bolster his chances to survive, it wouldn't guarantee it."

=== Survive1 ===
You tell her to hold off on using the medicine. It would be a waste to use it if he is likely to die anyway. She isn't pleased with your decision. Luckily, he manages to survive the night. Ripley says that he will be able to get back to work in a day or two, and that she will make sure he doesn't continue his drug abuse.
-> END

=== Dies1 ===
You tell her to hold off on using the medicine. It would be a waste to use it with the chance he'll die anyway. She isn't pleased with your decision. Within a few hours, he's dead. Itâ€™s impossible to tell whether the medicine would have made a difference. That said, it's better than losing both the crew member and the medicine.
-> END

=== Survive2 ===
You have her administer the Conaxel. The crewman survives the night, and Ripley explains he will be able to get back to work after a few days rest. You make it clear that any further drug use will not be tolerated. More importantly, the credits for the Conaxel will be coming out of his pay.
-> END

=== Dies2 ===
You have her administer the Conaxel. Unfortunately, while the medicine stabilizes his condition at first, he worsens overnight. By morning, he is dead. The credits to refill your stock of Conaxel will have to come from your account. Ripley apologizes, a pained and somber expression on her face, for suggesting it.. 
-> END

== Medbay ==
You instruct Ripley to prepare a bed in the Medbay for the man. After administering some stabalizing agents through an IV the man drifts in and out of consciousness. While he recovers you have a security officer confiscate the rest of the man's drug stash. A few hours later the man, now sober, vows to "never touch that shit again".
