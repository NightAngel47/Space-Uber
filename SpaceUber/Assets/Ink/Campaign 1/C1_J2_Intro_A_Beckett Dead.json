As you set off to your next destination, several of the elites have started to set up for an auction they will hold during the flight, with some of the proceeds going to charity. Many of them are also excited for the next tourist spot: a safari on an alien world, where they will have the opportunity to hunt exotic and dangerous creatures.","\n","^Luckily, no one seems to notice Beckett's absence.
