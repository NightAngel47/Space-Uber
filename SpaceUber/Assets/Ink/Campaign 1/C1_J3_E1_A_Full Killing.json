Near the front of the pack is a clone of Miniver Beckett, smugly holding a wine glass. He grins at you before speaking, \"Thanks for doing what you were told so far. It's been awfully convenient for us.\" he sounds just like his original, voice hardly interesting enough to listen to, \"But keep in mind, you're the one with bloody hands here, not us. So if you don't go all the way...\" he trails off.

You'll get your money and nothing unsavory will have to happen between us.\" He takes a long sip of his drink, \"It's nice to have our own lapdog eh?\" He glances back at the rest of the clones, grin in profile.

Drop your passengers off there instead and you can wash your hands of it.
