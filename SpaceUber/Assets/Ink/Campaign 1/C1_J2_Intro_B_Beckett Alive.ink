When you stop at a station to refuel and restock, you pick up several dozen more elites. As you set off to your next destination, the newcomers begin to set up for an auction they will hold during the flight, with some of the proceeds going to charity. Many of them are also excited for the next tourist spot: a safari on an alien world, where they will have the opportunity to hunt exotic and dangerous creatures.
A few hours into your journey, you receive a transmission. It is the clones, and as the designated speaker starts to talk, you can hear annoyance in his voice: "Although we didn't expect you to have killed all of them, we had hoped you would have had an opportunity to take out one or two. We know they expect to go on safari before your next pit stop" his voice gains a slightly threatening edge to it, "We expect news of an 'accident' during their hunting expedition, or there may be an 'accident' in your future too."
