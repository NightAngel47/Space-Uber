The Kellis Corporation is putting on a corporate retreat for a few of its business partners. You have been assigned by Kellis to transport the CEOs of these companies across several starports and vacation destinations. 
While you entertain these elites, their companies are being run by clones of themselves.
You suspect Kellis is using this retreat as a distraction to make some plays in the business world, potentially leveraging these clones, but you simply need to play your part and get a couple hundred credits in tips.
You have guests to entertain! About twenty sleek black suits file onto your ship. A few seem amused by the "rustic aesthetic" of the place while others complain about the heat. 
You estimate that being in a cargo bay is a new experience for the lot of them, and usher them to their quarters quickly. Loaded on the ship along with them are pallets of liquor and other necessities to keep them entertained. 
As you keep an eye on the curious guests, you receive a transmission. At first glance, the video appears to show all of your new passengers sitting in an office building.
Considering that theyâ€™re all happily fraternizing in your ship, means you must be speaking to the clones. 
One of the figures begins to speak slowly, as if emphasizing their words, "Your guests... the tyrants you're carrying... we need you to kill them... save us and your loyalty will be rewarded." The transmission cuts to static, leaving no trace of itself on your system.
