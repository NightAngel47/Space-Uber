The Kellis Corporation is putting on a corporate retreat for a few of its business partners. You have been assigned by Kellis to transport the CEOs of these companies to a vacation destination multiple starports away. While you entertain these elites, their companies are being run by clones of themselves. You suspect Kellis is using this retreat as a distraction to make some plays in the business world, potentially involving these clones, but you simply need to play your part. You have guests to entertain! And hopefully, you'll get a couple hundred credits in tips.

About twenty sleek black suits file onto your ship. A few seem amused by the "rustic aesthetic" of the place. You estimate that being in a cargo bay is a new experience for the lot of them, and usher them to their quarters quickly. Loaded on the ship along with them is a great deal of liquor and other necessities to keep them entertained. As you keep an eye on the curious guests, you receive a transmission. At first glance, the video appears to show all of your new passengers sitting in an office building, which is strange, considering theyâ€™re also all happily fraternizing in your ship. Which means must be speaking to clones. 

One of the figures begins to speak slowly, as if emphasizing their words, "Your guests... the tyrants you're carrying... we need you to kill them... save us and your loyalty will be rewarded." The transmission cuts to static, leaving no trace of itself on your system.
