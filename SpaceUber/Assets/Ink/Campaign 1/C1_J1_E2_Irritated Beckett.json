It appears he does, as he responds \"What is this shit! Are you trying to poison me with this slop?\" He follows up his crude response by uncerimoniously knocking the tray out of her hand. Indignant, she calls out for you to do something about him. Beckett follows her lead and shouts back, \"This is my vacation, so I think I deserve some real food. Right, chauffeur?\"","\n","^Although Beckett is making an ass of himself and treating Lanri and the rest of the crew unfairly, he's still a client.
