When you stop at a station to refuel and restock, you pick up several dozen more elites. As you set off to your next destination, the newcomers begin to set up for an auction they will hold during the flight, with some of the proceeds going to charity.
Many of them are also excited for the next tourist spot: a safari on an alien world, where they will have the opportunity to hunt exotic and dangerous creatures.
Luckily, no one seems to notice Beckett's absence. You have insured that it will remain as such by noting that Beckett got off at the pit stop and didn't return.
A few hours into the flight, it becomes apparent that the clones have gotten word of this, as they message you.  The speaker, who shares the face and voice of the man you killed, starts speaking, his tone revealing his satisfaction. 
"We have heard that Beckett has 'disembarked.' Good work. As promised, you'll find some credits added to your account as compensation. Continue doing as we have asked, and this will be but a drop in the bucket."
As the transmission cuts out, you receive notice that 100 credits have been added to your account.
