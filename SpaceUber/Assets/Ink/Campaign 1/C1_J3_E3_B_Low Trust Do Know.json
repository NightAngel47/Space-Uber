Over the next day there are reports that a terrorist group had been decimated on the resort planet after attempting an attack.","\n","^Although some of the general details are true, such as the fact that the clones had planned to kill a group of prominent business owners and company executives, their true connection to the elites is conspicuously absent. The VIPs no doubt want to bury the fact that the clones they left in charge of their companies tried to kill them.","\n","^As the payment comes in, you can see that it is indeed a substantially smaller amount than the one initially promised. While most of your clients did actually pay, many of them did not meet the price that was agreed upon at the beginning of the trip.","\n","^Your handling of this trip cost you some credits, but you still made a good amount and the losses could have been much worse.","\n","^A little later, however, you receive an encrypted message. Decoding it, you find a video file. Several figures stand shadowed, and when one speaks out, you can tell the voice is electronically garbled, \"Your betrayal cost us everything.","\n","^\"Our chance at living free from the shackles we were born into and our chance of retribution towards our tormentors.

As you set down, you leave the bay doors to your ship closed. The clones are gathered with their mercenaries, pointing rifles at your ship, waiting for sight of their originals.","\n","^The ringleaders of this conspiracy, the clones of Beckett and Whitwer, step forward. Olivia Two calls out to you, \"Well, we have been expecting you.

Open those doors so we can kill those bastards!\" You give the signal.","\n","^The bay doors snap open, and a hail of fire bursts forth from the opening. In seconds most of the clones are dead, having energy blasts burn through their vital organs or melt their heads like candles. A few manage to get shots off before they are slaughtered.","\n","^You commend the security crew you had stationed in the bay on their quick reflexes and true aim. You will have to fix the damage the stray shots had done to your hull, as well as replace the unfortunate crewman who had his face liquidized by a plasma blast.","\n","^Having the rest of your crew gather the bodies, you start to head back to where the elites are vacationing. Seeing as Whitwer had seemed to act as a leader of the group, you send her a video of the clones: Them awaiting you, Beckett Two's vile intentions, and their subsequent demise at the hands of your personnel. You also tell her that you hope to receive a rather generous payment for dealing with this threat.","\n","^A few hours later, you receive a communication from the resort. Whitwer, representing the group of elites, speaks calmly: \"After much discussion, we have decided to reward you for your action in keeping us safe. Not only will you receive the promised amount for taking us to our destination, but we will also include a bonus you will find quite generous.\"","\n","^However, she continues, her eyes and voice filled with contempt, \"I know you were working with the clones, you just backstabbed them out of convenience, so do not think this is over.

Having been grouped together by your security, you notice they are starting to whisper among themselves.","\n","^All of a sudden, Whitwer shouts, \"Now!\" Chaos breaks out as the several elites pull blades and guns from their vests, rushing your security team. Weapons start going off, and several of your crew go down under the assault of the VIPs.","\n","^You have to give orders quickly, before you fully lose control of the situation.

While most of the elites lay unconscious, several of them are laying in pools of blood, as some of your security had acted before you gave orders.","\n","^Among the prone figures are several dead crew members, having been beaten and shot by your frenzied clients. The precious seconds it took to switch from kill to stun turned out to be critical.","\n","^As you land at the dock, you prepare the remaining elites, their hands bound, to be marched out. Those who perished in the preceding events have been unceremoniously stuffed into a spare cargo container, which you will present alongside their breathing brethren.","\n","^The clones are waiting in a group, flanked by metal-clad mercenaries, most pointing weapons towards the bay doors in preparation for the originals.

As a sadistic smirk crosses her face, she speaks, \"We wished to get retribution for the years of servitude and pain our originals put us through, right? What better way to get our revenge than to make them take our place? Let’s see how they like being used as spare parts.\"","\n","^Once more speaking to you, she speaks \"Thank you for all you have done. You will find that your reward will be a king's ransom. All that is left is to release the 'clones' into our custody.\" You open the bay doors and have security lead out the prisoners, as well as the container holding the slaughtered members.","\n","^The clones take over command of them, and you have security withdraw. As you get ready to leave, your sensors pick up Whitwer's clone standing above her now-kneeling original. Right before liftoff, you hear her gloat, \"I'm in charge now.

While a few of the crew members are heavily injured, they will survive. You have the bodies gathered and thrown into a spare cargo container.","\n","^You touch down at the coordinates given to you.

While I can't promise that the others will pay you generously for your help, I can assure you I will.\"","\n","^Leaving the bodies in their custody, you depart. A few days later a good amount of credits are deposited in your account.
