About twenty sleek black suits file onto your ship. A few seem amused by the \"rustic aesthetic\" of the place while others complain about the heat.","\n","^You estimate that being in a cargo bay is a new experience for the lot of them, and usher them to their quarters quickly.

At first glance, the video appears to show all of your new passengers sitting in an office building.","\n","^Considering that they’re all happily fraternizing in your ship, means you must be speaking to the clones.","\n","^One of the figures begins to speak slowly, as if emphasizing their words, \"Your guests... the tyrants you're carrying... we need you to kill them... save us and your loyalty will be rewarded.\" The transmission cuts to static, leaving no trace of itself on your system.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
