Your passengers are well aware of the conspiracy against them, most of them producing small weapons from their waistcoats before you land. You land directly in the abandoned docking bay the clones pointed you to, a huge circular room with no roof, a tangle of shadows and catwalks along its walls. You know that whatever lurks here won’t be enough for the VIPs to handle on their own. Regardless, they step out of the cargo hold, brandishing their weapons. 

Gunshots ring out as metal-clad mercenaries lurch out of the shadows. The two sides exchange shots, bullets ricocheting off your ship and the VIPs fire arcing red beams from their sidearms. You’re certain the clones are the more prepared faction of the two, but involving yourself in the fray could tip the scales to the elites’ advantage. The extra factor of your weapons and your security team can destabilize this entire fight. The question is who can you trust to pay you when the smoke clears.
