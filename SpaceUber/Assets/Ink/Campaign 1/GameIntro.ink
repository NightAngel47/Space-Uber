Welcome and congratulations on being the newest member of the Kellis family! You are the latest achievement of Kellis’ R&D department: A self-conscious thinking machine. What is Kellis? Well, only the largest, most ubiquitous, and most dominant ultra-corporation in the known universe. We bend the galaxy to our will—it’s great business! 

Kellis has designed you to be a fully automatic captain and manager. In this trial run, you will transport persons and parcels  across the galaxy, representing corporate interests away from home. If you impress our leadership, you will be mass produced and make us all unheard amounts of sweet, sweet credits. 

Our CEO is expecting fantastic results from this project. Don’t disappoint!
