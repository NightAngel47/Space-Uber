He speaks with a posh British accent and carries himself gracefully.","\n","^\"They will let me do it, or they will regret it,\" the second elite responds. He is Tyler Bale, a sharply dressed younger man with slicked back hair. Bale calls out to you, straight to the point, \"I want to pilot the ship for a bit.\"","\n","^Yorkshire interjects, \"Just because you took a lesson or two piloting a Sky Sailer does not make you qualified to steer a corporate transport ship.\"","\n","^Annoyed, Bale bites back, \"I have always wanted to be a pilot! Father is the one that insisted I take over his company.\"","\n","^Turning away from the older gentleman, the young man speaks to you again: \"Well, what is it going to be? Are you going to let me put my superb skills to use, or am I going to have to withhold your pay?\"","\n","^It would be dangerous to let him pilot through the ship, even for a short time; there are numerous asteroids in this area. You can prevent major damage, but some might still get through. Either way, you have to choose between making him happy or staying safe.","\n","ev","str","^Let Bale Pilot","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Refuse","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Ride"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"NoRide"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Ride":["^You decide to let him pilot the ship for a while.

I hope you know what you are doing, for the sake of yourself and everyone else.\"","\n","^You assure the elder elite that you can take back control at a moment's notice. After about a half hour of piloting Bale starts to lose interest and allows himself to get distracted by one of Yorkshire's colorful comments.","\n","^Due to this lack of focus, the ship is almost in a head-on collision with huge chunk of space debris. Taking back control, you maneuver the ship so that it avoids obliteration. The hull is slightly damaged, however, as the side scrapes against the asteroid.","\n","^Slightly embarrassed, Bale laughs and leaves.
