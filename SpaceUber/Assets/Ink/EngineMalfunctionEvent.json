While the engine itself was built to withstand extremely high temperatures, the surrounding hull doesn't have quite the same threshold. If you don't do something soon, this wing of the ship is going to start melting like an ice cube in an incinerator. Readings show that certain parts of the engine have become unstable, and the only way to get it to cool down would be to fix it.","\n","^The easiest solution is to send in some engineers to fix it. Survival is not guaranteed, but their employment contracts keep liability down. The risk to the engineers could be lowered if replacement parts were located, but said parts would come from somewhere else on the ship and might cost more to replace than a few men. Lastly, considering your destination isn't too far off, you could risk it. After all, the engine is still doing its job pushing your ship towards the delivery point. And your hull was built to withstand a lot of punishment.","\n","ev","str","^Risk Engineers","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Use Parts of Ship","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":4},"ev","str","^Leave the Engine Be","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",["ev","visit",2,"seq","/ev","ev","du",0,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.s0","c":true},"ev","du",1,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.s1","c":true},"nop",{"s0":["pop","\n",{"->":"Survive"},{"->":".^.^.17"},null],"s1":["pop","\n",{"->":"Sacrifice"},{"->":".^.^.17"},null],"#f":5}],"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"Repair"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["^ ",{"->":"Leave"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Survive":["^You order the engineers to fix the engine.
