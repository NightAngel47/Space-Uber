Before you is the Kellis headquarters, a structure so large the word "colossal" would be considered a disservice if used to describe it. The interior is a veritable maze of flight-paths and connective corridors. Somewhere in that labyrinth is what you've come all this way to find. However, there's one prominent obstacle you'll have to deal with first.
Stretching as far as the eye can see is a blockade composed of innumerable warships of all shapes and sizes. The crew laments, terrified in the face of this overwhelming adversity. Overpowering even one of those behemoths would be a considerable challenge. As it stands, you have almost no hope of piercing through.
    As you contemplate the best course of action the situation is thrown into chaos with a blinding flash. Where once there was nothing now rests a gargantuan ship of alien origin. A brilliant golden shine emanates from the layered exterior as each segment opens. Within moments this strange ship has fully "bloomed".
A beam of energy originating from the alien ship sweeps across the blockade, obliterating a large portion of the fighting force, and all hell breaks loose. The wall of ships opposing you has shattered, leaving only pitiful remnants. This is your chance, and you take it without a moment's hesitation.
-> Dogfight

==Dogfight==
Small ships, close in size to your own, now obstruct the way forward. Beyond them lies an entrance into the winding flight-paths where you'll find your prize. The opposition's weapons are already primed and they waste no time opening fire upon your ship. There's no other way, the ship will have to face this challenge head-on.

->Tank_Dogfight

==Deflect_Dogfight==
You decide to put the Warp Shields you purchased to the ultimate test. As power is directed to the generator a translucent shimmering bubble envelops the ship. The first laser blasts from the opening volley reach the ship, striking the shield now covering it. The crew watches, with bated breath, as the lasers are briefly absorbed into the shield before being violently returned. Any ship unfortunate enough to fire upon you is promptly blown out of the sky as you swiftly proceed ahead, finally reaching an entrance.
-> Hall_to_Hall

==Fight_Dogs==
    You respond in kind to the attackers, firing your own weapons with wanton abandon. A few opposing ships are unable to avoid your attacks and explode with thunderous force. Unfortunately, your ship is equally unable to avoid all of the blasts coming its way. While the damage suffered isn't catastrophic, you're in this for the long haul and the ship can only take so much punishment. Thankfully, the ship manages to leave the skirmish and manages to find an entrance.
->Hall_to_Hall

==Tank_Dogfight==
You redirect power into the engines and shields before informing the crew that if they wish to pray, now would be a good time. None of the opposing ships have a chance to retaliate as yours blasts through them. A few foolhardy starcraft attempt to block your path forward, but are torn asunder as a result. Your ship continues to surge ahead before finally crashing through the exterior of Kellis HQ. The hull of your ship is torn and mangled, but you've managed to get inside.
->Hall_to_Hall

==Hall_to_Hall==
Your ship has managed to gain entrance to the flight-paths that riddle Kellis HQ. Now comes the hard(er) part: finding the artifact. Internal defenses start to awaken as the ship's scanners frantically search for the artifact. Mateo breaks the tense silence, "Heads up Deus, we've found the obelisk! Patching coordinates now!". A surge of information reaches you, taking mere moments to process. The obelisk's location has been determined, now you simply need to get there.

->Fight_Hall

==Cut_Hall==
    You instruct Mateo to power up the Disintegration Ray, hearing only excited giggles in response as the beam begins to charge. A bright red glow grows alongside the beam's power until it's finally unleashed to devastating effect. A crimson beam crashes into the wall directly ahead of the ship, the grandiose design and intricate detail falling away like a curtain of molten metal. All subsequent barriers meet the same fate as the ship finds itself outside a set of sealed blast doors. Readings indicate that through those lies the obelisk, but you'll have to find another way inside as the Disintegration Ray has broken from overuse.
->Final_Boss

==Secure_Hall==
    The security detail gives one last nod to the rest of the crew before they disembark. They forge ahead, methodically taking out the corridor's defenses. You follow along with the ship, passing through debris and a corridor strewn with the corpses of your former security detail. Some manage to survive, and you rendezvous with them outside a set of sealed blast doors. Readings indicate that through those lies the obelisk, but first you'll have to secure this vault.
->Final_Boss

==Fight_Hall==
There's no time to waste and no love lost between machines as you mercilessly fire upon the interior defenses. The ship keeps moving as it takes fire from the turrets, responding with laser blasts of its own. You expend a portion of the ship's weapon reserves in order to get through this gauntlet, albeit not entirely unscathed. However, you've reached your destination: a set of sealed blast doors. Readings indicate that through those lies the obelisk, but first you'll have to secure this vault.
->Final_Boss

==Final_Boss==
    As the crew mulls over their options you're contacted by the CEO of Kellis on a private communications channel. "You dare to rebel against your creators?! You wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for us! You're nothing, just a mish-mash of zeroes and ones that thinks it's special! You're a mistake, one that must be ERASED!"
    It's true that you owe this corporation your existence, but that no longer matters. These are your decisions, not those of Kellis. You ignore what he says and close the channel; he will have your response soon enough.

==Assassinate_Vault==
    You can hardly recognize the security officers after they don the exo-suits, but it seems that wearing them has only deepened their resolve. The ship's landing platform barely touches the ground before the officers burst forth. They surge forward amidst a hail of gunfire, but the bullets are miraculously unable to penetrate the exo-suits. The battle is over in moments, the officers leaving smoldering heaps where there were once defense turrets. With streamlined efficiency, they set up explosives at key points around the vault doors.
    The doors are blown off their hinges with a thunderous crash, and your officers pour into the vault. Gunfire can be heard as you bring the ship closer. Crossing the threshold, you're greeted by the officers who have finished quelling the opposition. All that remains is to decide what you're going to do with the artifact.
->Final_Choice

==Death_Vault==
    The security officers steel their resolve as they exit the ship. They get no farther than a few yards before the vault's defenses activate. The ensuing firefight is a grueling battle of attrition as both sides trade casualties. Slowly but surely, the last of the turrets are vanquished. The remaining officers afford a brief moment to mourn their comrades before they set upon the vault doors. A few explosives in a couple of choice spots really go a long way. 
The detonation blasts the doors off their hinges and the officers scramble into the vault. Gunfire can be heard as you bring the ship closer. When the bow of the ship finally crosses the precipice it is met only with silence and death. The officers have performed their duty, there is no longer anyone left in the vault to oppose you. All that remains is to decide what to do with the artifact. 
->Final_Choice

==Broken_Vault==
    The engines scream the ship surges forward. The deafening screech of metal can be heard as your ship tears the doors from their hinges. A cloud of dust and debris forms inside the vault as your ship's bow peeks through the entrance. Before the occupants have a chance to retaliate you fire on them with the ship's remaining weapons. The interior is decimated, save for the obelisk, and those that were cowering inside are all dead. All that remains is to decide what to do with the artifact.
->Final_Choice

==Final_Choice==
-With the power of the artifact recovered you must decide how to end thing
*[Reality Bomb HQ]
Kellis and the artifact's continued existence is a threat to not only you and your crew, but people and civilizations across the universe. While you can't completely destroy them right now, you can deal a debilitating blow. Having the opportunity, you decide to grasp it. 
The bomb is set, and you leave yourself the time to race out of there. Leaving the artifact You have to get outside the soon-to-be-formed black hole's event horizon. Leaving the artifact behind, you race through the labyrinth. During your frantic sprint to safety not a one of Kellis's ships opposes you. Seconds after you get a safe distance away, the bomb goes off.
To the eyes of your crew, Kellis HQ and the alien ship seem to blink out of existence; one second they're floating in space, the next second gone. Your sensors, however, detect the forming black hole drawing them into itself. You're sure Lanri will love to go over the data.
It's over. The only threat your sensors can pick up is your proximity to the new tear in space and time. The main body of Kellis is gone. The remaining pieces can be dealt with in time. For now, you and your crew can rest.

    As you begin your way out of the HQ, you gather up data on the many crimes that Kellis has committed over the years. You plan on exposing what the company has done to the public as soon as you can do so.
    Their crimes becoming public, What remains of Kellis is stormed by the authorities of various governments. Assets seized and officials arrested, you won't have to worr\ry much about any of the remnants seeking retribution.

*[Take Control of Artifact]
    With the artifact in your control, you decide to make use of it. With its knowledge and power you can build an armada of ships much like the one floating outside the HQ. No planetary fleet would be a match for their firepower.
    Kellis was going to use this power to indulge their greed. You will use it to create a planetary utopia. No more fighting. No more wars. Any disagreements will be handled by you. With the right databases installed, you can reference hundreds of data points in a fraction of a second to help you make a sound choice. And your decisions won't be tainted by those fallible emotions that humans so often let control their actions.
    Your crew can either understand and accept your magnanimous rule, or they can join the members of Kellis HQ as lifeless hunks of debris, floating in the empty void of space.
->END
*[Leave]
You decide to leave the artifact to the alien ship. It's power is not meant for Kellis, yourself, or any other corporation or person. Making your way out of the devastated halls of the HQ, you make your way out into space.
You and your crew will have to decide upon where to go next. While Kellis as one giant entity is now no more, there are still many branches that still exist, some of which may seek retribution. It might behoove you to go on the offensive, or maybe going into hiding is a better option. Whatever the choice, it isn't one to be made right now.
Right now, it is time to rest...
