The time has come to collect the last asset in this sector of the solar system. It is located in on a recently terraformed planet, Highlens, at a central government building.You fly between decorative columns into one of the building's hangers.
You are greeted by a politician in a sleek suit. "Hello, Captain. A pleasure to finally meet you. I heard you would be arriving to pick up some equipment on behalf of Kellis. It'll be brought up right away." Ge thinks for a moment. "I bet your crew hasn't gotten a break recently, I'll get some food for them in the meantime. Your company has done a lot for us, and given strange reports, we need you now more than ever."
The CEO told you to keep the Midas beasts secret, but it's clear that the government is in the dark about them. If you shared Lanri's research, they could help accelerate the development of a cure, but it would mean refusing a direct order from the CEO.

==ShowResearch==
You tell the man what you know about the Midas corruption, sending over Lanri's scattered research data.
"... My... my god. So the monsters we've been hearing about are people?" He rests his head in his hands, "I'll forward this to the other senators, we need to work towards a cure immediately." He runs off, throwing a word of thanks behind him while you finish loading the asset onto your ship. 
->Scene_2

==DontSayAnything==
You neglect to mention anything to the man. The asset is loaded onto the ship without incident. You thank the senator for his time and the meal and ready for departure.
->Scene_2

==Scene_2==
As you rise towards the cloud layer, alarms begin blaring throughout the complex. You decipher what this means as several golden obelisks pierce through the roof of the building. Within seconds, the employees begin to turn and the Midas beasts begin to drag the obelisks through the facility.
You are already in the air with the asset. Protocol dictates that since your objective is complete, you should avoid dangerous circumstances. However, helping out the government could work in your favor. 
+ [Help the Politicians]
-> HelpPoliticians
+ [Escape With the Asset]
-> EscapeWithAsset

==HelpPoliticians==
You shoot back down to the ground. Kuon heads the team, ripping through dozens upon dozens of Midas Creatures to rescue who they can. The Midas creatures, catching on to your plot, focus on your ship, leaping onto it and tearing at its sides. You suffer some heavy damage fighting in the hangar, but hold position until Kuon returns. Avanshore's government is dealt a heavy blow, but it is softened by your help.
-> END

==EscapeWithAsset==
You break the cloud layer and escape Highlens without any issues, leaving the government complex to fend for itself. Everyone within is probably doomed, but you successfully acquired another asset for Kellis.
-> END
