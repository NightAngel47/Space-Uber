The time has come to collect the last asset in this sector of the solar system. The last asset in this sector of the solar system is located in a new planet at a central government building. After a couple more days of traveling throughout the stars and planets, you arrive at your destination. You slowly descend down and take notice of the complex you will be landing at. A massive dome with columns staged all around the perimeter of the building. Further surrounded by a layer of ammo-filled defense against the Midas Creatures. You make your way to the landing dock inside one of the hangers in the complex.
You are greeted by a man in a stereotypical sleek suit. "Hello, AI. A pleasure to finally meet you. We have the asset right over here ready to be loaded. Your crew looks awfully tired, please allow me to feed them at no cost. They look like they need a good feast."
As you watch another solar flare scorch some trees in the distance, you realize that giving the planet's government Lanri's research could help accelerate a potential solution for the impending supernova. Conversely, Kellis would rather you not send the entire solar system into a panic. The choice is yours.

"... My... my god. Avanshore's star is going to supernova? I must tell the rest of my peers. He runs off while you finish loading the asset onto your ship. 
Once completed, you set off to collect the next asset. Right before you turn on your max ship speed, alarms begin blaring throughout the miles of terrain the government complex covers. You decipher what this means even before they start tearing into the walls of the complex. And there are even more Midas Creatures than last time.
You already are in the air with the asset, you don't have to worry about a potential failed escape this time. However, helping out the government could work into your favor. What would you like to do?

You shoot yourself back down to the ground. Kuon heads the team as you rip through dozens upon dozens of Midas Creatures. They eventually catch onto your attack. A few of the MCs leap high into the air and latch onto your ship. You're able to shake them off, but only after they rip some chunks of the hull and weapons off. You suffer some heavy damage overall, but the government is now forever in your debt.
-> END

==EscapeWithAssetA==
You escape without any issues and leave the government complex to fend for itself. Everyone in there is probably doomed, but you successfully acquired another asset for Kellis.
-> END


==DontSayAnything==
Loading the asset onto your ship goes as smoothly as it possibly could. you thank the Politician for his time and the meal and set off to collect the next asset.
