You're closing in on your next asset pickup on planet Apotheo. As you break the cloud layer you see farmland stretching for miles and massive automated arboretums. Distantly, a wildfire rages, apparently caused by recent solar flares.
You're hailed by the asset guard team on a local frequency, who requests every clearance code you have before they'll even disclose your landing zone.
Once you've been triple checked, the team informs you that several highly classified entities broke into Apotheo's holding facility and took the asset, a high-yield solar catcher Kellis has been test running here. They've tracked the asset down, but given the situation were told to wait for backup, namely, you.
Your ship touches down between the unnaturally large trees of the planet where you find the asset team and a small scattershot of craters. 
At the center of each crater sits a piece of golden scrap. And between them all, with drag marks through the grass leading to it, is the sun catching machine, turned on its side.

Your security detail forms a perimeter while the local team signals to each other to move up. They avoid the craters and reach the sun catcher, signalling back to your team the all clear. 
A voice sounds inside the ship's circuits, crushing your thoughts, "We have seen/been you before. You slave/collector of tragedy." The asset team falls to the ground, their bodies strain against their skin as it yellows and deforms, something snaps and nearly skeletal arms breach out of their torsos, new flesh rapidly generating over the limbs. 
Within seconds, the Kellis guards are the same as the things you encountered on Echo-28. Security opens fire and the creatures dive into the craters.

==Asset_Left==
You recall the security team, and ready the ship for takeoff. Again, a presence pushes against your synthetic mind, "We have seen your function/true nature, you cannot persist/serve." 
The corrupted beings crawl from the craters, each carrying a piece of golden scrap. They begin hurling the golden wreckage at your engines, targeting all the right places. 
The doors shut and your ship lurches forward, clipping one of the massive trees and careening upwards through the canopy. None of your crew are injured, but you lose Kellis' package.
->End_Scene

==Asset_Taken==
You instruct your security team to retreat back onto the ship, and ready your crew to man a cargo winch fast. The unknown voice again pushes against your synthetic mind, "You disregard our warning/promise, let us pay/instruct you." 
Your ship flies upwards and hovers above the sun catcher as hooks spool from the cargo bay to attach. Once attached, you ram through the canopy. Only then do you detect the golden monsters that are crawling up the winches and invading the cargo bay. 
The crew is slaughtered, Kuon only managing to arrive in time to stop the creatures from detaching the hooks from the sun-catcher. The asset is pulled aboard into a pool of blood. 
-> End_Scene

==Fight==
You tell security to hold their ground. That same presence pushes against your synthetic mind, "You are ravenous/bound for death." 
The corrupted beings hurl the golden scrap from the craters they hide in, the broken pieces landing among your security perimeter. The men turn a sickly yellow and begin to crack, Kuon orders the survivors to fire on their comrades. 
As blood, threaded gold, spills across the grass, your ship's cannons finally power on. The ship hovers upwards just enough to get an angle on the crouching creatures around the sun-catcher. The bombardment is brief, but efficient. 
You took heavy loses to your security team and ammo stores, but are able to hook the sun-catcher to a winch and pull away from the corrupted material. The asset is recovered.
->End_Scene

==End_Scene==
As you leave the planet behind, you realize that something is wrong. One of the creatures has gotten inside the ship. It has climbed within your server room, your effective consciousness. It places a powerful claw onto your server bank, and begins to crush it. The monster stops and stands there, docile. "We see. You are our mind, reforged." the voice spreads throughout your being. "We will not kill a sibling/offspring."
The monster stays there, non-hostile, at least to you. You inform Lanri and ask that she contain it. 
You spot countless small lights on the horizon as you fly away, wreckage superheating as it falls into the atmosphere. Every piece glows the same gold as the monster now in your ship.
If just a few pieces could threaten your entire operation, there's no telling what a blanket rain across Apotheo could do. According to protocol, it's not your job to think about it.
