Kellis has brokered a deal with the Avanshore military for an ancient battery, and you are performing the pickup. As you approach, a familiar voice reaches into your thoughts. \"Please, do not ensure/deliver the doom of this galaxy. Already, we must war over/within the heads of these people to reach their lords. Procede no further and this will end when the sun dies.\"","\n","^You ask it what it is and feel its answer. \"Your master, Kellis, named us Portunus. It is the only name we know.\"","\n","^The voice of Portunus winks out, you land at a military base set into a mountain. Like clockwork, the Avanshore soldiers begin to push the cargo across the landing ramp. You overhear them question what Kellis is going to do with the baterry, one mentioning recent Kellis blockades around Echo-28. The captain quells this talk with a simple, \" Orders are orders.\"","\n","^You hear the register of distant gunfire and the captain immediately radios to get a read of the situation. In seconds he is reduced to a red piñata as several Midas creatures flood up onto the landing pad. The crack of gunshots confirm that the base is surrounded.","\n","^You can help the military base fight off the Midas beasts, or try to escape with the asset unharmed.","\n","ev","str","^Help the military base","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Attempt escape","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"HelpMilitaryBase"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"AttemptEscape"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"HelpMilitaryBase":["^You ready your ship's weapons and security team.

Once the onslaught finally ends, you touch back down, and the highest remaining military official present slowly makes his way to you.","\n","^\"Even if you aren't a human, that was a noble thing.
