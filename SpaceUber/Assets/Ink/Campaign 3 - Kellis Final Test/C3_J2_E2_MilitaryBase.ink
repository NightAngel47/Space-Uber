You arrive on a new planet to collect the next asset. Right before you reach the location of the asset, a strange voice calls out to you. The words are almost intelligible but you hear some strings of words, the most prominent urging you to not collect all six assets together. 
Pondering the source of this voice, you land at a military base and some soldiers begin to load the asset onto your ship. Everything goes smoothly until you hear screaming in the distance. A military General yells out to determine the situation, before the sweeping impact of a Midas Creature instantly creates a red piÃ±ata out of him. And the continued screaming of soldiers indicates that more are on the way.
You can help the military base fight off the Midas Creatures, or try to escape with the asset unharmed.

==HelpMilitaryBase==
You ready your ship's weapons and security team. The superhuman nature of the Midas Creatures makes them a great foe. However, the combined might of your ship and the military base eventually smash through the seemingly endless waves of MCs. Once the onslaught finally ends, the highest remaining military official present slowly makes his way to you.
"What you just did for us was one of the most noble things I have ever seen... and you're not even human. We are forever in your debt. Please take a few of our base's resources, it's the least we can do for you. Best of luck on your mission."
-> END

==AttemptEscape==
You underestimated the power of the Midas Creatures. As their superhuman speed sends hoards of them to bombard your ship far before you can make your escape. You ready your ship's weapons and security team to fend some of them off. You succeed, but not before the asset gets stolen by the MCs and you suffer damage all over your ship.
-> END
