You arrive on the volcanic jungle planet Ballast to receive your next asset. Kellis has brokered a deal with the Avanshore military for an ancient battery, and you are performing the pickup. As you approach, an uncanny voice reaches into your thoughts. "Please, do not ensure/deliver the doom of this galaxy. Already, we must war over/within the heads of these people to reach their lords. Procede no further and this will end when the sun dies."
You ask what it is and feel an answer. "Your master, Kellis, named us Portunus. It is the only name we know."
The voice of Portunus winks out, you land at the mountain base. Like clockwork, the Avanshore soldiers begin to push the cargo across the landing ramp. You overhear them question what Kellis is going to do with the battery, one mentioning recent Kellis blockades around Echo-28. The captain quells this talk with a simple, "Orders are orders."
You hear distant gunfire and the captain immediately radios to get a read of the situation. He is reduced to a red pinata within seconds of several Midas creatures flooding up onto the landing pad. The crack of gunshots confirm the base is surrounded. 
You can help the military base fight off the Midas beasts, or try to escape with the asset.

==HelpMilitaryBase==
You ready your ship's weapons and security team. Waves of monsters now crawl up the sides of the mountain. However, the base is built to repel such attacks, and with you, they have air support. The monsters can't keep up with the hail of gunfire and sweeping aerial lasers. Once the onslaught finally ends, you touch back down, and the highest remaining military official makes his way to you.
"Even if you aren't a human, that was a noble thing. Any other Kellis goon would have taken their chance to escape. Thanks for sticking with us. Take some supplies for the voyage, it's the least we can do." Aferwards, the asset is loaded onto your ship, only an hour off schedule.
-> END

==AttemptEscape==
In the midst of the attack, you maneuver the ship into position and try to catch the asset in your loading bay, but it's not quick enough. The Midas creatures pull the asset and fling it down the mountain, and soon start to jump onto the sides of your ship. The base is lost within minutes while you attempt to locate the asset and fend off the beings clinging to the hull. 
Without the base's firepower, the mountain is overrun, and any hope at recovering the asset is lost. You take your exit, and rocket into space, the Midas beasts being ripped from the ship as you break the sound barrier.
-> END

==CowardEscape==
In the midst of the attack, you ignore the base and blast up into the atmosphere. You see the Midas creatures pull the asset and fling it down the mountain and move on to slaughter the soldiers. As the base is lost, you assure your crew that there was nothing you could have done, but the constant attacks are clearly getting to them.
