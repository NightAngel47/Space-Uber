Lanri hacks into Kellis and is able to steal 1,000,000 credits from them. She also the location of an exclusive and expensive black market in Kellis' files. This should prove useful in arming yourself to fight Kellis. With your new fat stack of space cash, you head over to the luxury black market.
You arrive and are greeted by a security officer, who quickly grants you entry into the market after noticing your Kellis top level clearance. She leads you into the first room. She mentions to you that the last room has the most expensive items, so you should save a large amount of money for it. You are then shown 3 items for sale. Your ship only has the capacity to handle one of these items from each room.

==GatlingArsenal==
For your upcoming battle you decide the best defense is a solid offense. You tell the seller that you'll purchase the arsenal of gatling guns. "Excellent choice. These babies can chew through even the toughest armor in a matter of seconds. I won't ask what you're going to use 'em for, but I'd hate to be on the business end of these."
With your choice made, you are led to the next room. With your offense boosted, it might be smart to upgrade other areas of the ship.

Simply point the end at whatever you want and watch in amazement as it’s reduced to little more than a puddle.” Assuming what he says is true, this should make getting into Kellis significantly easier. 
You are led into the next room of scavenged alien technology and advanced prototypes. Much of it is held in glass cases or suspended with chains from the ceiling. As the merchant in this room tries to sell you on his wares, you hone in one two items in particular: A sleek bomb of a dark metal and a small alien drive. 
The barker, seeing your interest, explains that the bomb is designed to create a gravitational singularity in the shortest time-frame possible. Scientists do not understand what this weapon would do, but they agree that it would be unpleasant for those on the receiving end. The data drive, he explains, contains an intelligence that has been used for decades to hack into high security systems. Either one could drop Kellis to their knees in the right situation.

==AncientAITool4A==
You purchase the hacking tool and a employee carefully removes it from its glass case. The merchant transfers you the various codes required to use it while you transfer over your credits. You can feel the data drive probing the world around it, its electronic mind curious. You're glad the both of you are working together. You stay at the market for another hour while your purchases are loaded, but you can feel that the time for preparations is over.

==DontBuyAnything3M==
You decide not to purchase any highly dangerous prototype, as much for your safety as for your credit count. The merchant smiles back at you and tries to console himself helping you load your previous purchases. You stay at the market for another hour while this happens, but you can feel that time for preparations is over.

==WarpShield4==
The barker gives a small nod of agreement, “Wonderful choice, that one. If you’re looking for protection then look no further! The Wondertastic Warp Shield is guaranteed to keep your ship safe from threats both tall and small.” You hope you won’t have to find out the hard way if he’s lying. 
You are led into the next room of scavenged alien technology and advanced prototypes. Much of it is held in glass cases or suspended with chains from the ceiling. As the merchant in this room tries to sell you on his wares, you hone in one two items in particular: A sleek bomb of a dark metal and a small alien drive. 
The barker, seeing your interest, explains that the bomb is designed to create a gravitational singularity in the shortest time-frame possible. Scientists do not understand what this weapon would do, but they agree that it would be unpleasant for those on the receiving end. The data drive, he explains, contains an intelligence that has been used for decades to hack into high security systems. Either one could drop Kellis to their knees in the right situation.

==RealityBomb4B==
You purchase the bomb, and make sure your crew is very careful while loading it. The merchant transfers you the various codes required to use it while you transfer over your credits. It's only one bomb, but you could eliminate a structure or even a planet using it. You stay at the market for another hour while your purchases are loaded, but you can feel that the time for preparations is over.

==SecurityExoSuits4==
The barker puts his arm around the display suit, “If you’re looking for a challenge then you’re looking for something else. These suits are top of the line and will make sure that whatever scuffle you find yourself in, you’ll come out on top.” Your security officers will be excited about the new gear, and you hope that the suits will work as advertised.
