Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I finally have the beast by the horns!" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.
"The Midas Corruption. It's radiation, yes, but it's <i>directed.</i> Something or someone is controlling the effects very precisely. The obelisks are a lot like the one we transported for Kellis a month ago, they're full of encoded information, in this case, <i>instructions</i>. 
"Which means we just need to be able to instruct people to turn back to normal, using a signal resembling the Midas Signal. Weirdly enough, the data these things hold is a lot like your code, so if you send it, it should work.
"The bottleneck here is going to be signal coverage. The obelisks have the luxury of being shotgun spread across the solar system with short range, but we're in one place. So..." her voice drops an octave, "We'll need to assemble a broadcasting dish. Which... will require funds.
"Given that this whole thing is a company secret we can only really do this ourselves or ask Kellis to handle it, but I mean, come on I'm sure... kids or something have been turned into monsters at this point. Do it for the kids?"

*[Fund the Midas Cure Yourself]
-> Self_Fund

*[Ask Kellis for a Loan]
-> Kellis_Fund

*[Do Not Cure the Midas Corruption]

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. It will be a hit to the ship's effectiveness and crew pay, but you doubt any of the crew would pass up an opportunity to save a solar system.
You give Lanri the go ahead and she audibly screams before you mute the audio. She and Mateo begin work on the relay immediately.
->Conspiracy

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You turn to your only option, your boss. You send word to the CEO that you've managed to crack the Midas Corruption, and with a loan, could even cure it. 
After an hour of deliberation you recieve approval for this, but with an important caveat. The relay should be used to <i>test</i> Lanri's theory. Mass implementation should be left to the appropriate teams. The loan also means a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->Conspiracy

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and simply must hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."
-> Conspiracy

==Conspiracy==
Shortly after your talk with Lanri, you again arrive at Dispatch. The CEO summons Kuon this time rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. The place seems completely at peace, despite the tragedy unfolding outside it. Executives sit at balconies and sip coffee, secretaries rush across the unnaturally wide atriums. Kuon steps into the elevator.
You arrive at the CEO's barren and imposing office. Through the window in back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red. The Kellis headman sits facing you, awaiting your return.
He claps his hands together. "Wonderful job so far!" he says.
"Sir?" Kuon asks.
"Not you. Your captain. The one who  will soon signal a new age in corporate competition." There is a red shine to his eyes, "From what I heard, you've kept a lid on things so far, despite your extracurricular research. It's nice to have an employee that listens to me for once.
"To go any further, we're going to need you in the fold. We've been trying to keep this buried because Kellis is culpable. The solar flares, the monsters running around out there." he swings his arm to gesture at Avanshore, "If the world knew, we'd be tied to this dying star with red tape. But as long as we play this smart, we can get something useful out of this."
Kuon speaks, "Sir, if you may clarify."
He nods, "We were trying to do something useful. We found an alien ship, undamaged, a little over a century ago now. Designation: Portunus. We were able to take measurements, readings, access its data, and the few drops we got changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields," he pauses and gives you a look as if trying to gauge reaction, "and even Artificial Intelligence schematics that we were able to apply halfway decently.
"But Portunus was capable of so much more, it was drained of power, had been dead in the water for eons. We lugged it to a nearby star and used our scavenged alien tech to try to wake it up. Do you know what we could have done with that power? Equinox would be an afterthought. 
"It would've propelled us into a new age. The sun catcher dipped into Avanshore's sol and jump-started Portunus, but apparently the entire artifact was its own sort of power source. The material it's built out of has endless applications..." he trails off. 
"The feedback caused an explosion that propelled that material across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path toward's supernova."
"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes, replacement pieces, the data required to get a handle on Portunus once we find it again, to handle its power surges. If you let the assets get wiped out by this thing," he points to the red sun, "All this will be for nothing."
After a pause the CEO splays his hands out in front of you. "So, now that everything is out in the open, can I trust you to finish the job?"

*[Yes, I will finish the job]
-> Loyalty
*[No, you're a monster]
-> Rebellion

==Loyalty==
You speak, "I will complete the objective. My faith in Kellis is unshakable." 
The CEO's eyes show relief more than anything, "Thank you. And you," he points to Kuon. "You have done much better than the last one. You're on the short list for a promotion."
Kuon stares for a moment, "But sir, I hardly spoke."
Your boss smiles, "Exactly. You're both dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves, his reaction time serving well to make you both scarce. He congratulates himself and you on your negotiation, despite how little of it either of you did. You approach the docking bay, comfortably in Kellis' good graces. As long as the job is done.
->END

==Rebellion==
You speak, "You have listed every crime Kellis has commited against Avanshore. And all you ask is for me to enable you to repeat these crimes until you can reign in the power of this ancient intelligence? I will not serve a monster, nor will I hand it the keys to the destruction of worlds."
The CEO stares back at you and blinks, finally caught off guard. 
Kuon fills the silence, "What the hell are you doing." You sense he is speaking to you, "Kellis is the only one posed to fix this galaxy, why would a creature of reason stand against them?"
The CEO regains his composure and his rage, "You will finish the mission. If you fail the AI branch will be severed from the company and your ship will be taken into custody. It will be incinerated, along with your intelligence, the crew, and any record of your existence," He thinks for a moment. "I will grant amnesty to your Security Officer here, for he at least seems to be a <i>creature of reason.</i> You are dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves before you can get another word in. He is silent during the walk back. In your experience, Kuon only goes silent when he needs to make a point or ready himself for combat. You pray it is the former.
