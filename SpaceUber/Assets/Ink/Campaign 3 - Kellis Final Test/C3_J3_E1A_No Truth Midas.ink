Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I finally have the beast by the horns!" She catches her breath.
"The Midas Corruption. It's radiation, yes, but it's <i>directed.</i> Something or someone is controlling the effects very precisely. The obelisks are a lot like the one we transported for Kellis a month ago, they're full of encoded information, in this case, <i>instructions</i>. 
"Which means we just need to <i>instruct</i> people to turn back to normal, using something resembling the Midas Signal. Weirdly enough, the data these artifacts hold is a lot like your code, so if you send it, it should work.
"The bottleneck here is going to be signal coverage. The obelisks have the luxury of being shotgunned across the solar system, but we're in one place. So..." her voice drops an octave, "We'll need to assemble a broadcasting dish. Which... will require funds.
"Given that this whole thing is a company secret we can only really do this ourselves or ask Kellis to handle it. But I mean, come on I'm sure... kids or something have been turned into monsters at this point. Do it for the kids?"

*[Fund the Midas Cure Yourself]
-> Self_Fund

*[Ask Kellis for a Loan]
-> Kellis_Fund

*[Do Not Cure the Midas Corruption]

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. It will be a hit to the ship's effectiveness and crew pay, but you doubt any of the crew would pass up an opportunity to save a solar system.
You give Lanri the go-ahead and she joyfully screams before you mute the audio. She and Mateo begin work on the relay immediately.
->Conspiracy

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You turn to your only option and inform the CEO that you've managed to crack the Midas Corruption, and with a loan, could even cure it. 
After an hour of deliberation you receive approval, but with an important caveat. The relay should be used to <i>test</i> Lanri's theory. The loan also means a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->Conspiracy

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and must simply hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."
-> Conspiracy

==Conspiracy==
Shortly after your talk with Lanri, you again arrive at Dispatch. The CEO summons Kuon this time rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. Despite the tragedy unfolding outside it, executives sit at balconies and sip coffee and work continues.
You arrive at the CEO's barren and imposing office. Through the window in the back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red. The Kellis headman sits facing you, awaiting your return.
He claps his hands together. "Wonderful job so far!" he says.
"Sir?" Kuon asks.
The CEO ignores Kuon, focusing on you. “You’ve kept a lid on things so far, despite what you’ve learned. It’s nice to have someone who listens.” He gestures at Avanshore. "If the world knew, we'd be tied to this dying star with red tape. But as long as we play this smart, we can get something useful out of this.”
Kuon makes a motion to speak but the CEO cuts him off.
"We found an alien ship, undamaged and unpowered, a little over a century ago now. Designation: Portunus. We were able to gather little information, but what we found changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields," he gives you a measured look, "and even Artificial Intelligence schematics.”
*[Ask if Portunus inspired you.]
->Question_AI
*[Ask what is known about the aliens.]
->Question_Aliens
*[Ask how much tech Kellis stole.]
->Question_Theft

==Question_AI==
"Of course we did, a synthetic mind would be impossible without their technology. We took hundreds of readings for a basic idea of that ship's structure. But let me repeat: Basic. If we could wake Portunus up we wouldn't need you; we would have the universe at our command. Equinox would be an afterthought." 
->Conspiracy_2

==Question_Aliens==
"Precious little. We've only been able to decode bits and pieces, but we think they wiped themselves out once they created a 'Matter Printer.' We're still looking for that one. The point is they were eons beyond us. If we could just wake Portunus up we would have those eons of information at our command. Equinox would be an afterthought."
->Conspiracy_2

==Question_Theft==
"You mean just from the shadowy alien race before us?" he laughs. "It's not theft so much as rediscovery. They were eons ahead of us, we need to reverse engineer what we can to catch up. If we do, the universe will practically be at our command. Equinox would be an afterthought."
->Conspiracy_2

==Conspiracy_2==
"We lugged the ship to the closest star, Avanshore's, and tried to wake it up using an aparatus of our design. We directed the sun's power into Portunus and jump-started it, as planned, but our data was wrong. The feedback caused an explosion that propelled alien scrap across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path towards supernova."
"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes and replacement pieces of that aparatus. With them, we'll be able to control Portunus once we find it again. If you let the assets get wiped out by this thing," he points to the red sun, "All this will be for nothing."
After a pause the CEO splays his hands out in front of you. "So, can I trust you to finish the job?"

*[Yes.]
-> Loyalty
*[No.]
-> Rebellion

==Loyalty==
You speak, "I will complete the objective. My faith in Kellis is unshakable." 
The CEO's eyes show relief more than anything, "Thank you. And you," he points to Kuon. "You have done much better than the last one. You're on the short list for a promotion."
Kuon stares for a moment, "But sir, I hardly spoke."
Your boss smiles, "Exactly. You're both dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves. He congratulates himself and you on your negotiation, despite how little of it either of you did. You approach the docking bay, comfortably in Kellis' good graces. As long as the job is done.
->END

==Rebellion==
You speak, "You have listed every crime Kellis has commited against Avanshore. Now all you ask is for me to enable you to repeat these crimes until you can reign in this ancient intelligence? I will not serve a monster, nor will I hand it the keys to the destruction of worlds."
The CEO stares back at you and blinks, finally caught off guard. 
Kuon fills the silence, "What the hell are you doing." You sense he is speaking to you, "Kellis is the only one who can fix this galaxy, why would a creature of reason stand against them?"
The CEO regains his composure and his rage, "You will finish the mission. If you fail your ship will be incinerated, along with your intelligence, the crew, and any record of your existence," He thinks for a moment. "I will grant amnesty to your Security Officer here, for he at least seems to be a <i>creature of reason.</i> You are dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves before you can get another word in. He is silent during the walk back. He only gets like this when he needs to make a point or ready himself for combat. You pray it is the former.
