Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I finally have the beast by the horns!" She catches her breath.
"The Midas Corruption. It's radiation, yes, but it's <i>directed.</i> Something or someone is controlling the effects very precisely. The obelisks are a lot like the one we transported for Kellis a month ago, they're full of encoded information, in this case, <i>instructions</i>. 
"Which means we just need to <i>instruct</i> people to turn back to normal, using something resembling the Midas Signal. Weirdly enough, the data these artifacts hold is a lot like your code, so if you send it, it should work.
"The bottleneck here is going to be signal coverage. The obelisks have the luxury of being shotgunned across the solar system, but we're in one place. So..." her voice drops an octave, "We'll need to assemble a broadcasting dish. Which... will require funds.
"Since you leaked this particular company secret to the whole galaxy, we could ask the solar system for support in this plan, or ask Kellis for a loan. Otherwise we can fund it out of our own pocket. But I mean, come on I'm sure... kids or something have been turned into monsters at this point. Do it for the kids?"

==Avanshore_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. You send Avanshore's joint government Lanri's proposal, along with her meticulously documented notes. It takes longer than you would like, given the state of emergency, but the proposal is approved and funded with no cost to you. The senators thank you and call you "the system's lone hero."
You give Lanri the go ahead and she joyfully screams before you mute the audio. She and Mateo begin work on the relay immediately.
->Conspiracy

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. It will be a hit to the ship's effectiveness and crew pay, but you doubt any of the crew would pass up an opportunity to save a solar system.
You give Lanri the go-ahead and she joyfully screams before you mute the audio. She and Mateo begin work on the relay immediately.
->Conspiracy

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You turn to your only option and inform the CEO that you've managed to crack the Midas Corruption, and with a loan, could even cure it. 
After an hour of deliberation you receive approval, but with an important caveat. The relay should be used to <i>test</i> Lanri's theory. The loan also means a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->Conspiracy

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and must simply hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."

==Conspiracy==
Shortly after your talk with Lanri, you again arrive at Dispatch. The CEO summons Kuon this time rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. The place seems to be in a  frenzy, no doubt prepping the station to depart before they get caught up in this dying system.
The unfolding tragedy of Avanshore has gained attention around the galaxy, and many savvy reporters question whether Kellis is involved.
You arrive at the CEO's barren office. Through the window in the back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red, the silhouette of the the Kellis headman facing away.
"Do you know what you've done?" he says.
"Sir?" Kuon asks.
"Not you. Your captain, the one whose future is tied to this mission. The one whose failure shows that the world no longer needs us." He whirls around, his face looks shallow and his eyes shine red from the light of the sun. "Do you <i>know</i> what you have <i>done?</i>
"Everyone knows that we're involved now, something we took great pains to cover up. I don't think you realize just how important this is. We <i>did</i> this. We're culpable in this and you just pointed the whole galaxy at us."
Kuon makes a motion to speak but the CEO cuts him off.
"We found an alien ship, undamaged and unpowered, a little over a century ago now. Designation: Portunus. We were able to gather little information, but what we found changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields," he gives you a measured look, "and even Artificial Intelligence schematics.”
*[Ask if Portunus inspired you.]
->Question_AI
*[Ask what is known about the aliens.]
->Question_Aliens
*[Ask how much tech Kellis stole.]
->Question_Theft

==Question_AI==
"Of course we did, a synthetic mind would be impossible without their technology. We took hundreds of readings for a basic idea of that ship's structure. But let me repeat: Basic. If we could wake Portunus up we wouldn't need you; we would have the universe at our command. Equinox would be an afterthought." 
->Conspiracy_2

==Question_Aliens==
"Precious little. We've only been able to decode bits and pieces, but we think they wiped themselves out once they created a 'Matter Printer.' We're still looking for that one. The point is they were eons beyond us. If we could just wake Portunus up we would have those eons of information at our command. Equinox would be an afterthought."
->Conspiracy_2

==Question_Theft==
"You mean just from the shadowy alien race before us?" he laughs. "It's not theft so much as rediscovery. They were eons ahead of us, we need to reverse engineer what we can to catch up. If we do, the universe will practically be at our command. Equinox would be an afterthought."
->Conspiracy_2

==Conspiracy_2==
"We lugged the ship to the closest star, Avanshore's, and tried to wake it up using an aparatus of our design. We directed the sun's power into Portunus and jump-started it, as planned, but our data was wrong. The feedback caused an explosion that propelled alien scrap across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path towards supernova."
"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes and replacement pieces of that aparatus. With them, we'll be able to control Portunus once we find it again. If you let the assets get wiped out by this thing," he points to the red sun, "All this will be for nothing."
After a pause the CEO collapses into his chair. "Can I trust you to finish the job?"

*[Yes]
-> Loyalty
*[No.]
-> Rebellion

==Loyalty==
You speak, "I will complete the objective. I betrayed your better judgement in this matter and I will not do so again." 
The CEO sighs, the light in his eyes returns, "Thank you. And you," he points to Kuon, "You have done much better than the last one. You're on the short list for a promotion."
Kuon stares for a moment, "But sir, I hardly spoke."
Your boss smiles, "Exactly. You're both dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves, his reaction time serving well to make you both scarce. He congratulates himself and you on your negotiation, despite how little of it either of you did. You approach the docking bay, back in Kellis' good graces. As long as the job is done.
->END

==Rebellion==
You speak, "You have listed every crime Kellis has commited against Avanshore. And all you ask is for me to enable you to repeat these crimes until you can reign in this ancient intelligence? I will not serve a monster, nor will I hand it the keys to the destruction of worlds."
The CEO stares back at you and blinks, finally caught off guard. 
Kuon fills the silence, "What the hell are you doing." You sense he is speaking to you, "Kellis is the only one who can fix this galaxy, why would a creature of reason stand against them?"
The CEO regains his composure and his rage, "You will finish the mission. If you fail your ship will be incinerated, along with your intelligence, the crew, and any record of your existence," He thinks for a moment. "I will grant amnesty to your Security Officer here, for he at least seems to be a <i>creature of reason.</i> You are dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves before you can get another word in. He is silent during the walk back. In your experience, Kuon only goes silent when he needs to make a point or ready himself for combat. You pray it is the former.
