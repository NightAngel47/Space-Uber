Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I finally have the beast by the horns!" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.
"The Midas Corruption. It's radiation, yes, but it's <i>directed.</i> Something or someone is controlling the effects very precisely. The obelisks are a lot like the one we transported for Kellis a month ago, they're full of encoded information, in this case, <i>instructions</i>. 
"Which means we just need to be able to instruct people to turn back to normal, using a signal resembling the Midas Signal. Weirdly enough, the data these things hold is a lot like your code, so if you send it, it should work.
"The bottleneck here is going to be signal coverage. The obelisks have the luxury of being shotgun spread across the solar system with short range, but we're in one place. So..." her voice drops an octave, "We'll need to assemble a broadcasting dish. Which... will require funds.
"Since you leaked this particular company secret to the whole galaxy, we could ask the solar system for support in this plan, or ask Kellis for a loan, after all, it sounds like good publicity. Otherwise we can fund it out of our own pocket, but I mean, come on I'm sure... kids or something have been turned into monsters at this point. Do it for the kids?"

==Avanshore_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. You send Avanshore's joint government Lanri's proposal, with her meticulously documented notes. It takes longer than you would like, given the state of emergency, but the proposal is approved and funded with no cost to you. The senators thank you and call you "the system's lone hero" which is a strange title.
You give Lanri the go ahead and she audibly screams before you mute the audio. She and Mateo begin work on the relay immediately.
->Conspiracy

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. It will be a hit to the ship's effectiveness and crew pay, but you doubt any of the crew would pass up an opportunity to save a solar system.

->Conspiracy

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You turn to your only option, your boss. You send word to the CEO that you've managed to crack the Midas Corruption, and with a loan, could even cure it. 
After an hour of deliberation you recieve approval for this, but with an important caveat. The relay should be used to <i>test</i> Lanri's theory. Mass implementation should be left to the appropriate teams. The loan also means a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->Conspiracy

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and simply must hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."

==Conspiracy==
Shortly after your talk with Lanri, you again arrive at Dispatch. The CEO summons Kuon this time rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. The place seems to be in a  frenzy, no doubt prepping the station to depart before they get caught up in this dying system.
The unfolding tragedy of Avanshore has gained attention around the galaxy, and many savvy reporters question whether Kellis is involved.
You arrive at the CEO's barren office. Through the window in the back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red, the silhouette of the the Kellis headman facing away.
"Do you know what you've done?" he says.
"Sir?" Kuon asks.
"Not you. Your captain, the one whose future is tied to this mission. The one whose failure shows that the world no longer needs us." He whirls around, his face looks shallow and his eyes shine red from the light of the sun. "Do you <i>know</i> what you have <i>done?</i>
"Everyone knows that we're involved now, something we took great pains to cover up. I don't think you realize just how important this is. We <i>did</i> this. We're culpable in this and you just pointed the whole galaxy at us."
Kuon speaks, "Sir, if you may clarify."
"We found an alien ship, undamaged, a little over a century ago now. Designation: Portunus. We were able to gather little information, but what we got changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields," he gives you a pointed look, "and even Artificial Intelligence schematics.”
"But Portunus was capable of so much more, it had been dead in the water for eons. We lugged it to a nearby star and tried to wake it up. Do you know what we could have done with that power? Equinox would be an afterthought. 
"The sun catcher dipped into Avanshore's sol and jump-started Portunus, but our data was wrong. The feedback caused an explosion that propelled that golden material across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path towards supernova."
"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes and replacement pieces required to get a handle on Portunus once we find it again. If you let the assets get wiped out by this thing," he points to the red sun, "All this will be for nothing."
After a pause the CEO collapses into his chair. "Can I trust you to finish the job?"

*[Yes, I will finish the job]
-> Loyalty
*[No, you're a monster]
-> Rebellion

==Loyalty==
You speak, "I will complete the objective. I betrayed your better judgement in this matter and I will not do so again." 
The CEO sighs, the light in his eyes returns, "Thank you. And you," he points to Kuon, "You have done much better than the last one. You're on the short list for a promotion."
Kuon stares for a moment, "But sir, I hardly spoke."
Your boss smiles, "Exactly. You're both dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves, his reaction time serving well to make you both scarce. He congratulates himself and you on your negotiation, despite how little of it either of you did. You approach the docking bay, back in Kellis' good graces. As long as the job is done.
->END

==Rebellion==
You speak, "You have listed every crime Kellis has commited against Avanshore. And all you ask is for me to enable you to repeat these crimes until you can reign in the power of this ancient intelligence? I will not serve a monster, nor will I hand it the keys to the destruction of worlds."
The CEO stares back at you and blinks, finally caught off guard. 
Kuon fills the silence, "What the hell are you doing." You sense he is speaking to you, "Kellis is the only one posed to fix this galaxy, why would a creature of reason stand against them?"
The CEO regains his composure and his rage, "You will finish the mission. If you fail the AI branch will be severed from the company and your ship will be taken into custody. It will be incinerated, along with your intelligence, the crew, and any record of your existence," He thinks for a moment. "I will grant amnesty to your Security Officer here, for he at least seems to be a <i>creature of reason.</i> You are dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves before you can get another word in. He is silent during the walk back. In your experience, Kuon only goes silent when he needs to make a point or ready himself for combat. You pray it is the former.
