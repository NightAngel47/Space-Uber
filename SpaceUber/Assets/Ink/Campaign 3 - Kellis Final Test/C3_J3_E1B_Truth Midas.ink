Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I finally have the beast by the horns!" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.
"The Midas Corruption. It's radiation, yes, but it's <i>directed.</i> Something or someone is controlling the effects very precisely. The obelisks are a lot like the one we transported for Kellis a month ago, they're full of encoded information, in this case, <i>instructions</i>. 
"Which means we just need to be able to instruct people to turn back to normal, using a signal resembling the Midas Signal. Weirdly enough, the data these things hold is a lot like your code, so if you send it, it should work.
"The bottleneck here is going to be signal coverage. The obelisks have the luxury of being shotgun spread across the solar system with short range, but we're in one place. So..." her voice drops an octave, "We'll need to assemble a broadcasting dish. Which... will require funds.
"Since you leaked this particular company secret to the whole galaxy, we could ask the solar system for support in this plan, or ask Kellis for a loan, after all, it sounds like good publicity. Otherwise we can fund it out of our own pocket, but I mean, come on I'm sure... kids or something have been turned into monsters at this point. Do it for the kids?"

==Avanshore_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. You send Avanshore's joint government Lanri's proposal, with her meticulously documented notes. It takes longer than you would like, given the state of emergency, but the proposal is approved and funded with no cost to you. The senators thank you and call you "the system's lone hero" which is a strange title.
You give Lanri the go ahead and she audibly screams before you mute the audio. Mateo and her begin work on the relay immediately.
->END

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. It will be a hit to the ship's effectiveness and crew pay, but you doubt any of the crew would pass up an opportunity to save a solar system.

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's argument to do it for the kids <i>is</i> compelling. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You turn to your only option, your boss. You send word to the CEO that you've managed to crack the Midas Corruption, and with a loan, could even cure it. 
After an hour of deliberation you recieve approval for this, but with an important caveat. The relay should be used to <i>test</i> Lanri's theory. Mass implementation should be left to the appropriate teams. The loan also means a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->END

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and simply must hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."
