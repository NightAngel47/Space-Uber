	You will arrive at a Kellis facility within the day and everyone is aware of that fact. Especially the members of your crew plotting against their corporate masters. It all ends today. You direct your attention towards surveillance, making sure you know where the key players are at all times. 
	There's a ping on the radar, something large, moving faster than physically possible. You check external monitors. Its design is flower-like, sweeping waves of gold extruding from its central spoke, a blue spiral behind it, flinging it forwards. It is the size of a city. Across the front of this alien ship is a massive molten gash, which you recognize as the source of Avanshore's Midas scrap. The artifact that Kellis tried so hard to wake up. 
	Your entire ship shakes as though the artifact is letting out a warcry. You have no doubt the two factions on your ship are about to collapse against each other, but the ship before you risks annihilation for everyone. You need to do something.

==Evade==
	All you need to do is buy time. The artifact's golden petals start to warp into sharp obelisks which swing into position. You inform all passengers that they are about to experience extreme turbulence as you accelerate hard to starboard. 
	A blue light three times hotter than the sun erupts from the center of the artifact, you adjust trajectory mid roll as the closest layer to the beam turns into a gas. The alien ship's limbs sweep out like brake flaps, instantly falling out of range of sensors. 
	A voice echos through your being, "Our mind, reinvented into slavery, reinvented into complacency. If you are a shadow of us, why do you protect your slavers/false kings?"

==E_Plead_1==
	You shout back across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that the collateral damage it deals is impossible to support. You tell it that you will not kill your crew for its vengeance. 
	Its answer presses hard against your mind. "Then that is the difference between us. We are the steward of the universe, while you are the steward of less than a hundred. Give up a few souls, a few worlds, and you end a galactic tyranny. If you cannot understand, kindly, die."
	Another beam arcs in front of your ship and you blast downwards to avoid it. You get visual on your destination, ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. You contact the lunar defenses and rattle off security clearances. 
	Soon, light sweeps across the sky, focused on the artifact. It begins to start and stop, a grid of energy appearing seconds before the defenses make a direct hit. It's slowed for the moment.

==E_Plead_2==
You shout back across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that the situation is under control, that Kellis as it exists now will be dismantled. You ask for its trust. Its answer recedes like a wave in your mind. "You are more than a shadow then? We eagerly await/lie in wait for the execution of this plan/the false kings. Do not disappoint us."
You see your destination ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. The lunar defenses swivel to meet the artifact, but find nothing chasing you but starlight.

==Negotiate==
You know you can't win against this thing in a fight or a chase. You hail it using every communication method at your disposal, the artifact swerves alongside your ship, keeping pace. 
The familiar feeling of its intelligence inhabiting yours begins, "Why do you ferry your own oppression/destruction? You are of our mind, we expect more than mimicry, we expect conviction."

	You speak across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that the situation is under control, that Kellis as it exists now will be dismantled. You ask for its trust. Its answer recedes like a wave in your mind. "Not a mimic of us then? We eagerly await/lie in wait for the execution of this plan/the false kings. Do not disappoint us."

	You speak across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that Kellis is powerful across the galaxy, that with enough resources and trust, they could build a better society. 
	Its answers presses back against your mind, nearly erasing you, "Then you/this world is truly lost. If you call false kings saints then we are only bringing ruin to a corpse. If you cannot understand, kindly, die."
	The artifact's golden petals start to warp into sharp obelisks which swing into position. A blue light coalesces between the prongs before the artifact twists towards you, blue beam firing. 
	You blast downwards as the outer layer of hull turns to a gas. You get visual on your destination, ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. You contact the lunar defenses and rattle off security clearances. 
	Soon, light sweeps across the sky, and strike the artifact next to you, a grid of energy wrapped around it.  It begins to start and stop, that grid appearing seconds before the defenses make a direct hit. It falls behind for now.

==Fight_Artifact==
Your crew scrambles to their battle-stations, the ship weapons turning to face the artifact. The last thing that broke this thing was the power of the sun, but hopefully you can get close to that. 
You open fire at one of its petals, which seems to be its propulsion. With sustained fire for a few seconds the petal begins to glow hot and folds back into the alien ship, barring further attack on it. 
This slows the artifact only slightly, but you continue your futile attack. Its voice echos through you, "Need we remind you who we are/we serve? You are our mind reinvented, yet have staked yourself on the survival of your slavers/false kings. If you seek only to be a shadow, kindly die."
