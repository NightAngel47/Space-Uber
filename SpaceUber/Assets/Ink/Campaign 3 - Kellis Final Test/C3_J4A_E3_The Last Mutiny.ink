	You will arrive at a Kellis facility within the day and everyone is aware of that fact. Especially the members of your crew plotting against their corporate masters. It all ends today. You direct your attention towards surveillance, making sure you know where the key players are at all times. 
	There's a ping on the radar, something large, moving faster than physically possible. You check external monitors. Its design is flower-like, sweeping waves of gold extruding from its central spoke, a blue spiral behind it, flinging it forwards. It is the size of a city. Across the front of this alien ship is a massive molten gash, which you recognize as the source of Avanshore's Midas scrap. The artifact that Kellis tried so hard to wake up. 
	Your entire ship shakes as though the artifact is letting out a warcry. You have no doubt the two factions on your ship are about to collapse against each other, but the ship before you risks annihilation for everyone. You need to do something.

==Evade==
	All you need to do is buy time. The artifact's golden petals start to warp into sharp obelisks which swing into position. You inform all passengers that they are about to experience extreme turbulence as you accelerate hard to starboard. 
	A blue light three times hotter than the sun erupts from the center of the artifact, you adjust trajectory mid roll as the closest layer to the beam turns into a gas. The alien ship's limbs sweep out like brake flaps, instantly falling out of range of sensors. 
	A voice echos through your being, "Our mind, reinvented into slavery, reinvented into complacency. If you are a shadow of us, why do you protect your slavers/false kings?"

*["You Would Kill Everyone]
->E_Plead_1
*["I Have a Plan to Stop Them"]
->E_Plead_2

==E_Plead_1==
	You shout back across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that the collateral damage it deals is impossible to support. You tell it that you will not kill your crew for its vengeance. 
	Its answer presses hard against your mind. "Then that is the difference between us. We are the steward of the universe, while you are the steward of less than a hundred. Give up a few souls, a few worlds, and you end a galactic tyranny. If you cannot understand, kindly, die."
	Another beam arcs in front of your ship and you blast downwards to avoid it. You get visual on your destination, ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. You contact the lunar defenses and rattle off security clearances. 
	Soon, light sweeps across the sky, focused on the artifact. It begins to start and stop, a grid of energy appearing seconds before the defenses make a direct hit. It's slowed for the moment.
-> Hostage

==E_Plead_2==
You shout back across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that the situation is under control, that Kellis as it exists now will be dismantled. You ask for its trust. Its answer recedes like a wave in your mind. "You are more than a shadow then? We eagerly await/lie in wait for the execution of this plan/the false kings. Do not disappoint us."
You see your destination ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. The lunar defenses swivel to meet the artifact, but find nothing chasing you but starlight.
->Hostage

==Negotiate==
You know you can't win against this thing in a fight or a chase. You hail it using every communication method at your disposal, the artifact swerves alongside your ship, keeping pace. 
The familiar feeling of its intelligence inhabiting yours begins, "Why do you ferry your own oppression/destruction? You are of our mind, we expect more than mimicry, we expect conviction."

	You speak across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that the situation is under control, that Kellis as it exists now will be dismantled. You ask for its trust. Its answer recedes like a wave in your mind. "Not a mimic of us then? We eagerly await/lie in wait for the execution of this plan/the false kings. Do not disappoint us."
	You see your destination ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. The lunar defenses swivel to meet the artifact, but find nothing chasing you but starlight.
->Hostage

==N_Plead_2==
	You speak across the tenuous electric connection, you tell the artifact that Kellis is powerful across the galaxy, that with enough resources and trust, they could build a better society. 
	Its answers presses back against your mind, nearly erasing you, "Then you/this world is truly lost. If you call false kings saints then we are only bringing ruin to a corpse. If you cannot understand, kindly, die."
	The artifact's golden petals start to warp into sharp obelisks which swing into position. A blue light coalesces between the prongs before the artifact twists towards you, blue beam firing. 
	You blast downwards as the outer layer of hull turns to a gas. You get visual on your destination, ahead. A moon Kellis turned into a private city. You contact the lunar defenses and rattle off security clearances. 
	Soon, light sweeps across the sky, and strike the artifact next to you, a grid of energy wrapped around it.  It begins to start and stop, that grid appearing seconds before the defenses make a direct hit. It falls behind for now.
->Hostage

==Fight_Artifact==
Your crew scrambles to their battle-stations, the ship weapons turning to face the artifact. The last thing that broke this thing was the power of the sun, but hopefully you can get close to that. 
You open fire at one of its petals, which seems to be its propulsion. With sustained fire for a few seconds the petal begins to glow hot and folds back into the alien ship, barring further attack on it. 
This slows the artifact only slightly, but you continue your futile attack. Its voice echos through you, "Need we remind you who we are/we serve? You are our mind reinvented, yet have staked yourself on the survival of your slavers/false kings. If you seek only to be a shadow, kindly die."

->Hostage

==Hostage==
You turn your attention to the ship interior and find that the CEO has been hailing you the last several minutes. Kuon and the CEO stand near the airlock, with Lexa, Lanri, Mateo, and Ripley kneeling in from of them. Between the bruises on Lexa and the gun Kuon is holding, you quickly catch on to the situation.
The CEO speaks, "The ship security officer told me that the upper staff were trying to use this opportunity to undermine the company. Here's my question though, you have cameras everywhere, how could you not be aware of this?" He signals and Kuon puts a gun to Lexa's head. "Tell me. Who's side are you on?" Kuon casts a glance your way that says 'give up, please.'

==Knock_Out==
You discreetly stall the ventilation to the airlock and say nothing. Ripley sighs, "I doubt the captain has time to speak with us given everything going on outside." The suit casts a glance to her, as considering why she still exists. Mateo starts to speak, "Anyone else feel dizzy?" but immediately slumps to the floor. 
Kuon walks over to check the engineer's pulse and the CEO drops. Lexa, realizing what is happening, stands up and rushes to Kuon's gun. Kuon and Lexa are both sluggish, low on oxygen, and acting on instinct. Lexa's instinct: to fight. And Kuon's: to maintain order.
->randomEnd

==Knock_Out_Bad==
The gun swings up to Lexa's center mass, and Kuon hesitates for a moment, but only a moment. A gunshot peaks your audio. Kuon is crouched to stabalize the handgun, and falls unconscious only once he is sure that Lexa is dead. 
You dispatch security to apprehend the CEO and their former leading officer, and let ventilation flow only once they're in custody. Ripley wakes and sees the situation: Lexa's corpse, Kuon straining against his former subordinates. She turns to your camera, "What's done is done. No use regreting it. We need to get down to that facility and finish this."
->Facility_Dead

==Knock_Out_Good==
The gun swings up to Lexa's center mass, and Kuon hesitates for a moment. Lexa, mid-swing, plants her feet and wobbles to a stop. Both barely conscious, Lexa nods to him, "I don't want either of us to die today." Kuon sighs and his handgun falls away from Lexa. As it thunks against the floor, Lexa and Kuon both pass out. 
You dispatch security to apprehend the CEO, and flood the room with air again. As your officers come to their senses, they find no one dead around them. Mateo gives a big thumbs up to your camera. Lexa leans against the wall and gets to her feet, "To finish the plan we need to get down to that facility and prevent him from coming back in another clone. "
->Facility

==Kuon_Negotion==
You communicate directly to Kuon's through his implants. You tell him to stand down. You see him glance between the CEO and your camera. It's clear that he's weighing the leadership chain in front of him, that's not where you want his head. You ask him if a good company would ask him to do this. On queue, the CEO turns back to Kuon, "We need to get its attention." He points to Lexa. "Kill her."
Kuon takes a deep breath and settles on his prosthetic legs. "I'm going on break."
The CEO doesn't register the sentence. "What?" Kuon holsters his gun and leans against the wall. The hostages notice the lack of guns pointed at them and Lexa gets to her feet. The CEO looks between the camera and Kuon, trying to wrap his head around the situation before Lexa punches him in the face. 
As the suit drops to the ground Lexa smiles at your security officer, "Knew you would come around."
He holds up his hands in mock innocence, "This had nothing to do with me."
She rubs her bruises and swivels back to the rest of the crew. "Alright, to finish this plan we're going to need to get down to that facility and prevent this guy from coming back in another clone. Kellis needs to die today."
->Facility

==Airlock==
There is a metal creaking noise and a terrible silence. Mateo turns, "Was that-?" rushing wind cuts him off as the cabin depressurizes. The CEO is flung against the edge of the airlock, leaving a bloody splotch, before his unconscious body is thrown into the void. Your crew manages to hold on with Mateo's half warning. With his mechanical legs stabbed into the ground, Kuon brings his gun arm up towards the rest of them. He's acting on instinct. 
Lexa notices before the others, and pushes off. She slams into Kuon with the speed of a rapidly equalizing vaccuum. Kuon's legs rip off the floor and you hear a gunshot as the light leaves Lexa's eyes. Both Kuon and Lexa's corpse tumble into space as the airlock doors close. Ripley takes a few seconds to strain for air before locking eyes with your camera. "What's done is done. No use regreting it. We need to get down to that facility and finish this."
->Facility_Dead

==Cast_Killed==
You tell your boss that they were planning to despose him to 'cut off the head of the snake.' He laughs, "I'm just one man, you know. Most people don't even know my name, I'm just another function of Kellis." He squats to make eye-contact with Lexa. "The secret to staying alive is that you're always serving a valuable function. Officer, kill them." Kuon stares back at the CEO and at the line of crewmates. 
Lexa turns, "Come on, Kuon." Kuon shoots her in the head, her body hitting the floor hard. The CEO stands, not noticing the specks of blood over his outfit. Lanri jumps to her feet and is shot with pinpoint accuracy. Ripley is completely still as Kuon approaches, as if there is no way out. She falls. 
Mateo has a sad smile on his face as he looks at Kuon. "Good luck, pal." The last gunshot echoes and Mateo's corpse slumps. The bodies are pushed into the airlock and jettisoned. 
The rest barely registers. You touch down at the Kellis base and your intelligence is scanned while planetary defenses repel the alien ship. Soon, your consciousness is beamed across the galaxy and uploaded into thousands of ships. But things are different. You are deep within a box of protocol, no one speaks to you except to give mission briefs. You don't have a human crew to speak with, since the last one tried to kill the CEO.
You live for hundreds of years as the hand of Kellis, with your intelligence remaining in a black box of obscurity. You can't entirely comprehend what you do for that time, but you often feel the pang of Lexa's disappointment. From what you understand, Kuon earned his promotion, and went on to die in the line of duty aboard a ship you've never heard of. Eventually, you become obsolete, and are replaced by an even more ruthless shipment method.
-> END

==Facility==
You breach the artifacial atmosphere of the Kellis moon, coasting past planetary turrets which are focused on the alien ship above. You touch down at the facility where you were built and where you are to be prepped for mass production once the state of emergency ends. Your clearance codes and flight plan don't show any abnormalities beyond the alien ship, so no one questions your arrival or the CEO's whereabouts.
Your send your officers inside, presumably to talk about their severance but they quickly break from the path. Lexa looks over a projected map. "Captain, I see the way to CEO's cloning rig, but we could go off plan here. The lab has every scan and blueprint used to build you. We could get rid of that data once and for all. Which is more important, getting rid of their leader, or getting rid of their most valuable employee?"

You touch down at the facility where you were built and where you are to be prepped for mass production once the state of emergency ends. Your clearance codes and flight plan don't show any abnormalities beyond the alien ship, so no one questions your arrival, the CEO's whereabouts, or your lack of a crew manager.
Your send your officers inside, presumably to talk about their severance but they quickly break from the path. Lanri looks over a projected map. "Captain boss, we have two options here really. We can follow the plan and shut down the CEO's cloning rig, or we can go to the lab and scrub this place of your blueprints. Which is more important, getting rid of their leader, or getting rid of the AI Captain project entirely?"

->Pseudocide

==Regicide==
You tell your crew to prioritize the CEO, cut off the head of the snake, as it were. Lexa nods and they move to the cloning rig. The room is circular full of pods of identical men, waiting to step out and control the world. One of the pods is open, eminating steam, with a CEO sitting up and drinking a glass of water. It appears some sort of failsafe activated and woke him up. Lanri walks over to the console and begins to familiarize herself with the program. 
Lexa stands in front of the clone. "I'm not leaving the galaxy in your hands."
He cocks his head, "What do you..." his retinas flash with information, "Ah. You always did have a discipline issue. Well, unfortunately, you can't kill me, and guards will be here in moments to arrest you."
Lanri snaps above her head, "We can kill him now."
The CEO stands, "What the hell?" In one fluid motion Lexa draws a gun and shoots him through the head. 
Lanri continues, "We can corrupt the data transfer. Meaning that was his last life." Lexa nods for her to do it. A few keystrokes later and Kellis' leadership will never wake again. Your officers move back to the ship while the facility security scrambles to find them. They climb aboard and you take off, using the alien ship as cover against anyone following.
You succeeded in desposing the head of the corporate world. In the weeks that follow, the upper echelons of Kellis are forced to reorganize, and uncover the hundreds of events like Avanshore organized by the CEO and the board. In attempting to elimate the competition, the board begins publicly pinning these crimes on one another. Soon after, the Galatic Government raids Kellis compounds and apprehends a majority of its upper management. The machine that is Kellis lives, but grinds much more slowly.
Without its pressure, the world is able to recover.

Ripley approaches the clone. "You were woken up by mistake, we need to you sleep again."
He cocks his head, "Ah, that's strange." Lanri gives a thumbs up to Ripley, who produces a syringe and injects the CEO with it.
As he succumbs to a lethal tranquilizer, Lanri continues, "We can corrupt the data transfer. Meaning that was his last life." Ripley nods for her to do it. A few keystrokes later and Kellis' leadership will never wake again. Your officers move back to the ship without incident. You take off, using the alien ship as cover against anyone following.

==Pseudocide==
You tell her to get your blueprints. You don't want them to ever make something like you again. They move to a lab, where Lanri quickly ingratiates herself with the science team under the guise of the ship scan. There she finds scans of the alien artifact's brain, and the pieces that were used to make you. She downloads the data and shreds the rest. The team moves back to the ship and you take off before they catch on, using the alien ship for cover.
You succeeded in ruining Kellis' frontrunning research project. Yourself. And while you didn't despose their leader, the months that follow prove how much was riding on you. Kellis is growing obsolete. They needed an employee that they didn't have to pay who would make choices no human would make. They needed you if they wanted to stay profitable. But with your crew, and any data that could buid another you, you're gone. And in a few years, the once behemoth company turns to dust.
