The CEO seems to have learned from the previous encounter, and summons Kuon and you rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. The place seems completely at peace, despite the tragedy unfolding outside it. Men in suits sit at balconies and sip coffee, secretaries rush across the unnaturally wide atriums. Kuon steps into the elevator.","\n","^You arrive at the CEO's barren and imposing office. Through the window in back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red.

It's nice to have an employee that listens to me for once.\"","\n","^\"But things are only going to get more complicated from here. You need to know that Kellis is culpable.

But as long as we play this smart, we can get something useful out of this.\"","\n","^Kuon speaks, \"Sir, if you may clarify.\"","\n","^He nods, \"We were trying to do something useful. We found an alien ship, undamaged, a little over a century ago now. Designation: Portunus. We were able to take measurements, readings, access its data, and the few drops we got changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields\" he pauses and gives you a look as if trying to gauge reaction, \"and even Artificial Intelligence schematics that we were able to apply halfway decently.","\n","^\"But Portunus was capable of so much more, it was drained of power, had been dead in the water for eons. We lugged it to a nearby star and used our scavenged alien tech to try to wake it up. Do you know what we could have done with that power? Equinox would be an afterthought.","\n","^\"It would've propelled us into a new age. The sun catcher dipped into Avanshore's sol and jump-started Portunus, but apparently the entire artifact was its own sort of power source. The material it's built out of has endless applications...\" he trails off.","\n","^\"The feedback caused an explosion that propelled that material across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path toward's supernova.\"","\n","^\"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes, replacement pieces, the data required to get a handle on Portunus once we find it again, to handle its power surges.
