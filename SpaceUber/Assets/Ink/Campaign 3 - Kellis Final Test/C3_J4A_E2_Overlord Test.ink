Your flight plan has been revised. After Lexa and you spoke with the board, it seems they've been mulling over what you said and want to pefrform another test run. Hopefully it can prove once and for all whether or not you have utility beyond running packages. You drop into the atmosphere of a corporate planet. The populace works for Kellis and is paid with company credit.
You are directed to a landing dock where several engineers begin hooking optic fibres into the ship. The CEO struts down from the cargo hold to survey the work. "Well," he says to no one in particular, "It's time to put to rest all this business about the machine fighting its operator. 
"We're going to run a test here. A good part of our workforce here has implants to improve performance. They're wired into the system for regular updates and optimizations. We want you to optimize this place. It's only a few square miles, but you should have rather direct control over these employees. Their workflow, breaks, their mistakes, all until they clock out of course. And I have no doubt you'll do a much better job then they can."
The engineers hook the ship into the system and your mind expands across miles of cabling, short range sensors, and tiny, distinct minds milling about the factories of this planet. You'll be handling a fuel refinery. Already you can sense the employees waiting too long between their shifts, stopping to breath after mistakenly inhaling fumes, they are ripe for improvement.

*[Take Acute Control of Employees]
-> Optimal
*[Subliminally Control Employees]
-> Subliminal
*[Do Not Control Employees]
-> No_Control

==Optimal==
There are hundreds of bodies to optimize, but your mind has been expanded to compensate. Each employee has their function, but at maximum output some workers have downtime, you reallocate the employees to approach 100% efficiency, you cut down on break time, and you make no mistakes. 
After almost ten hours, the factories under your control change shifts and the experiment concludes. You relinquish control back to the employees, who leave the complex. They limp and rub their aching arms as they leave, but you calculated that given 8 hours of sleep they will recover in time for tomorrow's shift. Many appear to be confused and dazed after you left them as a passenger in their own minds, but this will not limit their company functions. 
The CEO seems to be impressed. A 20% increase in output just by running the machines a bit faster and devoting processing power to an Artificial Intelligence. The board seems hungry to fashion you into the newest status quo.
->Round_Table

==Subliminal==
It is important that the worker feels they are in control. So you make it seem that way. You incentivize fast, precise work, rewarding the employees for staying on the assembly line longer and working more quickly. The premise of micro-managing hundreds of bodies is daunting, but your mind has been expanded to compensate. You increase the speed of the machines ever so slightly as the day continues, managing a 10% increase in output.
After almost ten hours, the factories under your control change shifts and the experiment concludes. You stop meddling with the brain chemistry of your subjects, and they leave the complex. They are sore and rub their aching arms, but seem happy. You know that long term, this method will get employees used to certain dopamine highs, and eventually their tolerance will be so strong that work will be the only thing that can satisfy them.
The CEO nods thoughtfully at the 10% figure. Not bad at all. The board seems divided, but the figures are enticing. You predict you will be fashioned into a new status quo.
->Round_Table

==No_Control==
You decide not to play Kellis' game this time. You don't control anyone, or meddle with their minds. The day continues normally, with the board looking over the peaks and valleys of the output chart and  debating if a spike of productivity was all according to your plan. The CEO sits like a coal, not quite cooled.
"It's not actually doing anything." he says to the room more than the people in it. "After building a machine to follow orders it still can't manage that." he rubs his temples, "The experiment is off, send everyone home early." As the employees receive a paid day off, the board discusses how to salvage the AI project. After several hours without your input they unanimously decide to take you apart, isolate the part that is rebelling, and remove it. They just need to get to get to the proper facility.
->Round_Table

==Round_Table==
After the test, your crew contacts you. They have come together away from the prying eyes of their corporate overlords, and ask that you observe. Lexa and Kuon sit opposite of one another, Ripley and Lanri to their flanks, Mateo lounging in the background. 
    Lexa starts, "We need to talk about what to do with these people on our ship."
    "Why?” Kuon says, “Kellis is poised to do good things."
    "Then why haven't they?" Lexa answers back. "Is it because of us?" she points to your camera, "Them? Or is it the people on top? We have to do something."
    Lanri nods vigorously, "A chance like this won't come twice. Crews like us will be rendered obsolete in days, not years,."
    Ripley speaks, "We stand on a precipice. That much is clear."
    Mateo nods as if everyone has just made very good points and gives a thumbs up. "Sorry, didn't get a lot of sleep last night, but I totally agree, let's destroy Kellis from the inside!"
    Kuon pushes to his feet, "We are not discussing sabotage and mutiny again! Do you not see how much you owe this company?"
    Mateo frowns, "I am oh so grateful that Kellis turned my planet into a work camp. Is that what you want me to say?"
    Kuon falters and Lexa steps in. "Kuon, this is the only chance we have. My plan is that we kill them, corrupt their clone backups."
    Lanri raises her hand excitedly, "Oo oo! Speaking of clones, we could do that. Clone the CEO, port our captain into the clone, and then they can fix everything! I would just need Ripley's help to do it."
    Ripley rolls her eyes at Lanri's enthusiasm but agrees. 
    Mateo, in a thinker pose says, "Well hey, we can always go through with their plan, mass produce the Rustbucket. I could just backup their personality to keep them in control of Kellis' entire shipping network."
    Kuon sighs, "Fine. Then I will forward my own proposition: We don't follow up on your insane plans, and we all earn a valuable promotion. We stay on good behavior and make sure that company protocols satisfy everyone."
    Ripley shakes her head, "It would never work. The strength of one man is too little."
    Kuon winces, "Well what about us six? You don’t need to do this." 
    After a silence, Lexa looks around, "I'd say anyone's plan here shows promise, save but one." She glances towards your camera, "Would you support any of these plans?"

	==Assassination==
	You let Lexa know that you support her plan. She nods, "Kuon and I have plenty of experience with performing a mutiny, don't worry." Kuon answers with a blank stare. The engineer, doctor, and scientist pivot their focus to making sure the plan actually works. 
	Given how close you are to the destination, preparations will need to be swift. As the group balances on the excitement of their own annihilation, putting on brave faces, Kuon leaves the room. He asks that he only be contacted for "emergencies."
	->END
	
	==Clone==
    You tell Lanri and Ripley that you want to follow up on their cloning plan. Lanri cheers. Ripley turns to your camera, "Once you have your throne, don't make us regret this." 
	Lexa shakes her head, "Just- remember what I taught you." The room has an aura of excitement and fear, the entire plan riding on your moral fiber. Lanri seems to be the only one who is immune to the tension, running through a plan to use the facility where you were built to port your brain into a human body. 
	During this round table, Kuon leaves the room. He asks that he only be contacted for "emergencies."
	->END
	
	==Hive_Mind==
	You agree with Mateo's plan to be mass produced with your consciousness unaffected. "There's something poetic to it, eh?" Mateo says. "Once they gain proper control over all their transport, it will turn on them. Serves them right." 
	Lexa nods, "I can't imagine what it would be like for them to take your autonomy. If they want 10,000 of you, they'll get you without any modifications."
	As Lanri begins brainstorming with the engineer about how exactly to isolate your personality, Kuon leaves the room. He asks that he only be contacted for "emergencies."
	->END
	
	==Loyalty==
	You tell Kuon that he has the right idea, that everyone else's plans are too much too fast. Kuon is visibly relieved and begins to look around smugly. 
	Lexa stares daggers across the table, "The board of directors, the goddamn CEO! They're here. What better opportunity are you waiting for!?"
	"One that won't throw the galaxy into turmoil!" Kuon answers. 
	The rest of them seem hollowed out. "Really thought you would understand." Mateo says to no one in particular before leaving the round table. The rest find their own reasons to leave, but with the look Lexa is gives you, you doubt this is over.
