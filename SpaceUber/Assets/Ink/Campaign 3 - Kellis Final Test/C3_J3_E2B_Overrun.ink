While the rain of golden obelisks has slowed across Avanshore, your target planet is close to the sun and has been ravaged by wildfires, crippling its defenses and allowing the Midas creatures to take complete control. The only thing left are ruins, monsters, and, of course, two assets Kellis wants found immediately.  
Your preliminary scans lock in on an asset in a leaning skyscraper. It is absolutely crawling with Midas creatures. 
The voice of Portunus crackles across your brain, "This is what you/your lords have wrought/ensured. Leave this final/regrettable tomb. What you fetch only perpetuates our struggle."
Do you procede?

+ [Fight for the Asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollectionA
+ [Don't Collect the Asset]
-> DontCollectA

==AttemptAssetCollectionA==
Alone on the ruined planet, you begin strafing runs on the building, tearing down walls of Midas creatures who throw rocks back in your direction. Eventually, though, you need to move in to secure the asset. Once you enter their effective range, Midas beasts come out of the woodwork to tear down your ship. While you only need a few seconds to grab the asset, it's enough time for them to deal significant damage to you.
You then make your way to the next asset on this planet, located within the half-buried remains of subway tunnels. You can expect another horde of Midas creatures, but at close quarters this will be far more difficult. 
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

+ [Attempt to Collect the Asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollection2B
+ [Dont Collect It]
-> DontCollectB

==DontCollectA==
You fly away from the skyscraper and off to the next asset, determining it too risky to attempt to collect this one. You move to the next location, a half-buried network of subway tunnels. You can expect another horde of Midas creatures, this time at close quarters. Victory is uncertain at best.
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

+ [Attempt to collect the asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollection2C
+ [Don't collect it]
-> DontCollectC

==AttemptAssetCollection2B==
You launch an all out attack, bombing the tunnels and sending your security team in before the Midas beasts can recover. You lay down covering fire for several minutes, hoping to draw the monsters attention away from the small team fighting through the underground. As soon as the away team radios for pickup you swoop down to to find them, missing many of their members, but bearing the asset. You rush them aboard and flee the doomed planet.
-> END

==DontCollectB==
You fly away, determining it too risky to collect this one. Kellis' CEO might not be satisfied with you bringing one asset back, but it is clear that the price for another was far too high. You leave the doomed planet behind you
-> END

==AttemptAssetCollection2C==
You launch an all out attack, bombing the tunnels and sending your security team in before the Midas beasts can recover. You lay down covering fire for several minutes, hoping to draw the monsters attention away from the small team fighting through the underground. As soon as the away team radios for pickup you swoop down to to find them, missing many of their members, but bearing the asset. You rush them aboard and flee the doomed planet.
-> END

==DontCollectC==
You fly away again, determining it too risky to collect the asset. Kellis' CEO will likely be upset you didn't collect more assets when you had the chance, but it is clear that the price of two more was too high to pay.
-> END
