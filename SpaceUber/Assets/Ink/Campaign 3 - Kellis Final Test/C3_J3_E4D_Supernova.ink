With a mega solar panel strong enough to contain a supernova functional, you get ready to put it into action. During these preparation, the voice contact you again.
"Hello AI. I am glad I can finally reach you clearly. When Kellis awakened me, they intended to take over the enitre universe. I cannot allow this. I must protect the sacredness of my history and this universe. Will you help me destroy those assets and stop Kellis from causing more harm?

"Im glad we are on the same side. We will be in contact again soon." The artifact's voice then vanishes. You continue with the preparation for the solar panel, but you receive a transmission from the CEO of Kellis. 
"Hello again, my friend. Glad to be talking with just you this time. I understand you are in a good bit of danger, due to you unfortunate commitment to help save Avanshore. You are lucky that you are going to make me unheard of amounts of money. I must prove that you listen, so I can sell you everywhere. So, I have decided to assist you in saving Avanshore in order to guarentee your survival. We have been developing a cure for the Midas Creatures for a long time, and have recently completed it. We'll give it to you, but you must obey my every command in the future. Do I make myself clear, AI? If you disobey again, you will be terminated."

"Good. The cure shall be at your disposal within an hour. Don't forget our agreement." He ends the transmission before you can say anything else. 
You quickly receive the cure as promised. First you fly to Avanshore's Star. You carfully place the massive solar panel in position and prepare for whatever happens. A few minutes later, Avanshore's star explodes. Once the supernova finishes its course. You get a new visual of Avenshore. Everything is fine, the supernova has been stopped, but you must now cure the Midas Creatures.
You head back to the planets to begin spreading Kellis' cure. You fly all over the solar system spreading massive amounts of the cure throughout the planets. You watch as the Midas Creatures turn back into humans. 
Once you are finished, everyone is a normal human again. You saved Avanshore! But, will you continue to listen to the CEO?

-> END

The CEO violently throws his chair across the room and yells "We'll finish this later. You WILL obey me." He calm down a bit, then with a smirk says "the lives of you crew might depend on it." He chuckles and cuts the transmission.
You fly to Avanshore's Star. You carfully place the massive solar panel in position and prepare for whatever happens. A few minutes later, Avanshore's star explodes. Once the supernova finishes its course. You get a new visual of Avenshore. Everything is fine. Lanri's mega solar panel worked to perfection. You saved Avenshore! 
But actually, you didn't. It seems you forgot to fix the issue of the Midas Creatures. They now have the entire solar system at their feet. The citizens of Avanshore doomed.
