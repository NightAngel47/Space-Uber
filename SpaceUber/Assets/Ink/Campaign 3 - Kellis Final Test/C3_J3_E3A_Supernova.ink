With the cure to turn the Midas Creatures back into humans finished, you get ready to spread it around. During these preparation, the voice contact you again.
"Hello AI. I am glad I can finally reach you clearly. When Kellis awakened me, they intended to take over the enitre universe. I cannot allow this. I must protect the sacredness of my history and this universe. Will you help me destroy those assets and stop Kellis from causing more harm?

"Im glad we are on the same side. We will be in contact again soon." The artifact's voice then vanishes. You continue with the preparation for the cure, but you receive a transmission from an unknown source. 
"Hellooooo there AI! Thank you for answering. If you do not know, although surely you should, I am the CEO of Equinox. You could say were a bit a a rival to your friend Kellis. It seems that you are in a bit of a pickle. Imminent supernova gonna destroy you, huh? Well, I would like to offer you a solution. We have a Dyson Sphere technology that will contain the explosion.

"Good... hahaha... I am glad you see the logic in this partnership. The Sphere shall be at your disposal within an hour". She thanks you and ends the transmission. 
You quickly receive the sphere as promised. You immediatly head Avanshore's star and begin to wrap the sphere around it. You complete this process and head back to the planets to begin spreading the cure. You fly all over the solar system spreading massive amounts of the cure throughout the planets. You watch as the Midas Creatures turn back into humans. Lanri screams a the top of her lungs to celebrate her success. A few minutes later, Avanshore's star explodes. 
Once the supernova finishes its course. You get a new visual of Avenshore. Everything is fine. The Dyson Sphere worked to perfection. You saved Avenshore! But, what will Kellis think now?
-> END

==DeclineHelpA==
"Your loss then. Even the damn AI is a Kellis loyalist" The transmission then abruptly cuts out. You finish the preparations to spread the cure. You fly all over the solar system spreading massive amounts of the cure throughout the planets. You watch as the Midas Creatures turn back into humans. Lanri screams a the top of her lungs to celebrate her success. This celebration is short lived however. 
A few minutes after you escpae the solar system with everyone cured, Avanshore's star explodes. You use your ship's high speed capabilities to excape the blast. But, Avanshore wasn't so lucky. Once the explosion ends and you can get a visual of the solar system, there isn't a solar system to see anymore.
