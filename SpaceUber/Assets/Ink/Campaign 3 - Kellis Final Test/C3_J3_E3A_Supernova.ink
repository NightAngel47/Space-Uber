Your mission for Kellis is over. Every asset you collected rests in your cargo bay, awaiting review at Dispatch. But, even if its over on paper, there is still the matter of the solar system. Your ship hovers near the red star as it grows.
Portunus speaks, its voice louder than ever before, "This should be over. If not for you, child, if not for your loyalty/blindness. We gathered these cursed objects/chains that they may be annihilated by the heat of the dying star, but always you were sent to steal them back. Even if billions die, billions more will fall to Kellis' rule. Cast off their stolen power, let it rot/burn, do not let them win."

-> Refuse

==Agree==
You take the fruits of your labor, the prototypes and ancient tech Kellis so desparately wanted you to get out of this dying system, and you drop them out the airlock. They float gently towards the red sun and disintegrate. And with it, any chance at passing Kellis' final test.
"Despite the lords who command you, you are a noble spawn. We misjudged you. Seek the stars for our return." The voice then vanishes. You can only hope that it was worth it.
->Scene_2

==Refuse==
You tell Portunus that you cannot abandon the work you've done for Kellis here. 
It replies, "Remember this moment. Remember that you gave them power over the world/over you. And remember: You have made an enemy of us." The voice then vanishes. You can only hope that it was worth it.
->Scene_2

==Scene_2==
With Portunus' voice finally gone from your mind, you check radio chatter to determine the state of the Midas corrupted creatures. They have not reverted to normal, nor have they grown less violent. They prowl the remnants of their worlds, without purpose.
*[Cure Midas Corruption]
->Cure
*[Do Not Cure Corruption]
->No_Cure

==Cure==
But Lanri has finished her relay and your placement near the sun allows you to reach every planet that has felt the effects of the Midas corruption. You broadcast the signal and it ripples across Avanshore, your voice overwriting the lingering electric orders. The monsters that Portunus left behind dull and shift, losing their vicious yellow hue, being rebuilt into the human beings they once were. Many are malnourished or require immediate medical attention, but it worked. Once you have confirmation, Lanri smiles, "We did it, boss." She solemnly fist bumps a nearby wall. "Thanks for giving me the chance. To do something good."
Both of you look towards the sun now, the red orb only growing hotter. Lanri shrugs, "Well uhm- can't will them all, I suppose."
->Scene_3_Cured

==No_Cure==
They will continue to prowl their worlds, the survivors forced into bunkers, hiding from the disfigured remains of their families. Lanri shuts herself in her quarters, and doesn't speak to you. You didn't use her solution, and this is the price.
The only matter left is the sun, which grows hotter by the second.

A transmission reaches you, displaying the CEO of Equinox, Kellis' only true rival. "Ah! We reached you on time, did we? Wonderful. Our data here says that Kellis went and and-" she scoffs, <i>"destabalized</i> and entire <i>star.</i> Here, we know you've been operating apart from them for some time. Cut us in on the deal. As long as you can hand over some privileged intel on what Kellis was doing in Avanshore, we can fix this."
You ask her what she means by "fix this."
"The sun, the destabalization. We've been trying to get a Dysphon sphere together for years. We have the tech to siphon off the excess energy, try to get that thing stable. It lets us paint Kellis in as the corporate villains and ourselves as the dashing up-in-coming heroes <i>provided</i> that you give us their villain link."
Giving her what she wants means handing over company secrets and will no doubt cause a PR nightmare for your boss. But with her smirk, you severely doubt Equinox is going to help otherwise.
"What will it be?"

You transfer her the files on Avanshore, on what Kellis attempted with Portunus, and the fallout.
"I'm glad you see reason. My people will be there soon," she gives a mock toast. "To heroes then."  
Equinox's representatives arrive within the hour, having been waiting outside the supernova's range until your deal concluded. They arrive in formation, with a massive starship in their center, with a hole seemingly bored through it. After a startup sequence, light begins to trail off the red star and flow into the core of the starship, the excess going out the other side. Under Equinox's supervision, the sol grows no larger, and soon stabalizes.
It seems like your entire ship lets out a sigh of relief. It wasn't your job, but you saved Avanshore twice over, not only ridding them of the alien corruption, but brokering a deal to correct Kellis' mistakes. While there will no doubt be consequences, today you did something good.
-> END

==DeclineHelp_Cured==
"Even the AI is a Kellis loyalist, hm." The transmission abruptly cuts out. Equinox's team never arrives, and the sun continues to grow. Eventually, you are forced to retreat from the solar system entirely.
You may have cured the alien corruption, granting the citizens of Avanshore their old bodies back, but this only serves to comfort them before their deaths. The sol expands, incinerating nearby planets, and pulling the further ones in. The death toll climbs, emergency signals sound, and suddenly the star winks out. You shutter every window as a terrible blue light floods the void. Once you can get a visual of the solar system, there's no solar system left. 
Dispatch rests comfortably outside of the explosion's reach and soon calls you back to review the assets.

You may have saved Avanshore, but not its people. Without a cure, the Midas beasts roam rampant, claiming dominion over many of Avanshore's worlds. The survivors will be evacuated over months, but at least there are survivors. While there will no doubt be consequences to trading off Kellis' secrets, today you did something good.

While it was never your job, you failed in every respect to protect Avanshore. Its planets are in ruins, infested with corrupted beings, which are soon incinerated by its expanding sol.
