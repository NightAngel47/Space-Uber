With the cure to turn the Midas Creatures back into humans finished, you get ready to spread it around. During these preparations, the voice contacts you again.
"Hello AI. I am glad I can finally reach you clearly. When Kellis awakened me, they intended to take over the entire universe. I cannot allow this. I must protect the sacredness of my history and this universe. Will you help me destroy those assets and stop Kellis from causing more harm?

"I'm glad we are on the same side. We will be in contact again soon." The artifact's voice then vanishes. You continue with the preparation for the cure, but you receive a transmission from the CEO of Kellis.
"Hello again, my friend. Glad to be talking with just you this time. I understand you are in a good bit of danger, due to your unfortunate commitment to help save Avanshore. You are lucky that you are going to make me unheard of amounts of money. I must prove that you listen, so I can sell you everywhere. So, I have decided to assist you in saving Avanshore in order to guarantee your survival. We have Dyson Sphere technology that will prevent the suvernova from destroying the entire solar system. We'll give it to you, but you must obey my every command in the future. Do I make myself clear, AI? If you disobey again, you will be terminated."

"Good. The Sphere shall be at your disposal within an hour. Don't forget our agreement." He ends the transmission before you can say anything else. 
You quickly receive the sphere as promised. You immediately head to Avanshore's star and begin to wrap the sphere around it. You complete this process and head back to the planets to begin spreading the cure. You fly all over the solar system spreading massive amounts of the cure throughout the planets. You watch as the Midas Creatures turn back into humans. Lanri screams at the top of her lungs to celebrate her success. A few minutes later, Avanshore's star explodes. 
Once the supernova finishes its course. You get a new visual of Avenshore. Everything is fine. The Dyson Sphere worked to perfection. You saved Avenshore! But, will you continue to listen to the CEO?
-> END

The CEO violently throws his chair across the room and yells "We'll finish this later. You WILL obey me." He calms down a bit, then with a smirk says "the lives of you crew might depend on it." He chuckles and cuts the transmission.
You finish the preparations to spread the cure. You fly all over the solar system spreading massive amounts of the cure throughout the planets. You watch as the Midas Creatures turn back into humans. Lanri screams at the top of her lungs to celebrate her success. This celebration is short lived however. 
A few minutes after you escape the solar system with everyone cured, Avanshore's star explodes. You use your ship's high speed capabilities to escape the blast. But, Avanshore wasn't so lucky. Once the explosion ends and you can get a visual of the solar system, there isn't a solar system to get a visual of anymore.

"You will regret making an enemy of me." The artifact's voice then vanishes. You continue with the preparation for the cure, but you receive a transmission from the CEO of Kellis.
