After enduring your conversation with the CEO, you continue to the next section of the Avanshore. Roughly halfway through your flight, Lanri calmly contacts you, showing signs of great restraint from her usual energy explosion.
"Could I give my reading of happened back there, boss?" She begins speaking regardless of your answer, "That golden material looked like it was broken off from something larger, and pieces likely fell to Echo-28 days ago, causing the force we encountered there. Proximity to it transfigured the guards. It acted like radiation, but with a purpose, not affecting the surrounding plantlife, just the humans who got too close. Like the fabled Midas curse which turns anything to gold..." The unease in Lanri’s always-focused eyes breaks through.
"If I conduct some experiments on the Midas beast we captured I should be able to develop a cure to reverse the effects. However, the constant solar flares have also attracted my attention, and I fear they may be related. As the most advanced entity on the ship, which do you think I should research: The Midas Creatures, or Avanshore’s sol?"

==ExperimentOnMidasCreatures==
Lanri bobs her head up and down a few times before letting out a sigh of preparation. She heads off to her quarters to gather her materials. After several hours working with Ripley to inspect the isolated creature, she contacts you again. "I think I can do it! These things are like protein that can take orders. And I just managed to order one nano-meter of it to turn into helium. I know. Yes. Please hold your applause. Figuring out the exact conditions to recreate that on a larger scale is going to take a <i>little</i> time, but I think I can develop a cure to the Midas Curse, turn people back into people." Her eyes sparkle with scientific joy.

Lanri bobs her head up and down a few times before letting out a sigh of preparation. She heads off to her quarters to gather her needs materials. After several hours working with Mateo to gather solar readings, she contacts you again.
"Ummm boss, we a.. uh.. have a pretty big issue. So you know that star with the solar activity recently? It's approaching supernova. The Midas scrap seems be trapped in a cloud around it, somehow compounding the energy it produces. This whole solar system will be wiped out in a few weeks." Lanri flashes an almost devious smirk at you, "Unless we do something about it. I'm going to test-run some different disposal plans, and we'll go from there."
