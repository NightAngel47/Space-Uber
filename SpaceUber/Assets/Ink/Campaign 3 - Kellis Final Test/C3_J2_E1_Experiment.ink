After enduring your conversation with the CEO, you continue to the next section of the Avanshore. roughly halfway through your flight, Lanri calmly contacts you in a rare sight, showing signs of great restraint from her usual energy explosion.
"These falling golden obelisks are the reason people are turning into those creatures. It spreads its energy to humans and transforms them into those golden creatures, like the fabled Midas curse. Midas Creatures…" The unease in Lanri’s always-focused eyes breaking through. 
"If I conduct some experiments on the one we captured I should be able to develop a cure to reverse the effects of the obelisk. However, the constant solar flares have also attracted my attention. As the most advanced entity on the ship, I have a question for you. Which do you think I should research: The Midas Creatures, or Avanshore’s star?"
