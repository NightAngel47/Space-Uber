I have mastered the very cosmos!\" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.","\n","^\"The Supernova. It seems like it has everything to do with these golden obelisks we've been seeing. Those things seem to continuously produce energy, and the more the radiation they absorb from the sun the worse it gets. It's a feedback loop. Thankfully a lot of the scrap has been flung past Avanshore or to the planets below, but there's still a cloud of the stuff orbiting close to the sun. And the longer it sits there the worse this gets.","\n","^\"How it got there, I have no idea, but it can't have been for long given the sol's state. If we can clean it up, the problem at the very least won't get worse, and then it'll be a matter of siphoning off the excess energy so it doesn't hit its breaking point. Kellis should have proto-Dison tech to handle that part.","\n","^\"Really the issue here is funds. We cannot singlehandedly clean up the cloud of irradiated scrap around the sol, but with enough money or convincing, Kellis or local scrappers could handle the lion's share.","\n","^\"Given that it directly affects them, we could ask the citizens of Avanshore, but Kellis is also an option. I mean, come on, Kellis isn't so evil that they'd let a solar system explode because they don't stand to gain.\" She stops to think about what she said, and grows more concerned.","\n","ev","str","^Ask Avanshore for Help","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Fund the Sol Siphon","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Ask Kellis for a Favor","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":20},"ev","str","^Do Not Stop the Supernova","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-3","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Avanshore_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"Self_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["\n",{"->":"Kellis_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-3":["\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Avanshore_Fund":["^You send Avanshore's joint government Lanri's proposal, with her meticulously documented notes.

The CEO seems to have learned from the previous encounter, and summons Kuon and you rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. The place seems to be in a sort of frenzy, with employees rushing through its unnaturally wide atriums, no doubt prepping the station to depart before they get caught up in this dying system.","\n","^The unfolding tragedy of Avanshore has gained attention around the galaxy, and many savvy reporters question whether Kellis is involved. Kuon ignores the chaos and steps into the sleek elevator.","\n","^You arrive at the CEO's barren and imposing office. Through the window in back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red. The Kellis headman stands with his back to you, staring out at the system.","\n","^\"Do you know what you've done?\" he says.","\n","^\"Sir?\" Kuon asks.","\n","^\"Not you.

If they got their way we'd by tied to this dying star with red tape.\"","\n","^Kuon speaks, \"Sir, if you may clarify.\"","\n","^\"We were trying to do something useful. We found an alien ship, undamaged, a little over a century ago now. We were able to take measurements, readings, access its data, and the few drops we got changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields\" he pauses and gives you a pointed look, \"and even Artificial Intelligence schematics that we were able to apply halfway decently.","\n","^\"But that artifact was capable of so much more, it was drained of power, had been dead in the water for eons. We lugged it to a nearby star and used our scavenged alien tech to try to wake it up. Do you know what we could have done with that power? Equinox would be an afterthought.","\n","^\"It would've propelled us into a new age. The sun catcher dipped into Avanshore's sol and jump-started the artifact, but apparently the entire artifact was its own sort of power source. The material it's built out of has endless applications...\" he trails off.","\n","^\"The feedback caused an explosion that propelled that material across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path toward's supernova.","\n","^\"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes, replacement pieces, the data required to get a handle on that artifact once we find it again, to handle its power surges.
