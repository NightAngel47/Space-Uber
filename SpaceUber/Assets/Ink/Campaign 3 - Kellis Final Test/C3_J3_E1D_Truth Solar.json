I have mastered the very cosmos!\" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.","\n","^\"The Supernova. It has everything to do with these golden obelisks we've been seeing. Those things seem to continuously produce energy, and the more the radiation they absorb from the sun the worse it gets. It's a feedback loop. Thankfully a lot of the scrap has been flung past Avanshore or to the planets below, but there's still a cloud of the stuff orbiting close to the sun. And the longer it sits there the worse this gets.","\n","^\"How it got there, I have no idea, but it can't have been for long given the sol's state. If we can clean it up, the problem at the very least won't get worse, and then it'll be a matter of siphoning off the excess energy so it doesn't hit its breaking point. Kellis should have proto-Dyson tech to handle that part.","\n","^\"Really the issue here is funds. We cannot singlehandedly clean up the cloud of irradiated scrap around the sol, but with enough money or convincing, Kellis or local scrappers could handle the lion's share.","\n","^\"Given that it directly affects them, we could ask the citizens of Avanshore, but Kellis is also an option. I mean, come on, Kellis isn't so evil that they'd let a solar system explode because they don't stand to gain.\" She stops to think about what she said, and grows more concerned.","\n","ev","str","^Ask Avanshore for Help","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Fund the Sol Siphon","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Ask Kellis for a Favor","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":20},"ev","str","^Do Not Stop the Supernova","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-3","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Avanshore_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"Self_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["\n",{"->":"Kellis_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-3":["\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Avanshore_Fund":["^You send Avanshore's joint government Lanri's proposal, with her meticulously documented notes.
