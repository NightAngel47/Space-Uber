This planet is being completly overrun by the Midas Creatures. You must still continue with your mission, however. You first fly over to an old warehouse, completly surrounded my MCs. It almost seems impossible to get into the warehouse given the hundreds of MCs guarding it. What would you like to do?

+ Attempt to collect the asset
-> AttemptAssetCollectionA
+ Dont collect it
-> DontCollect

==AttemptAssetCollectionA==
You go into the chaos as a lone ship, Kuon leads the weapons team as they begin tearing down the walls of Midas Creatures. Eventually, you're able to create a gap. You enter the warehouse and quickly collect the asset inside. But not before many MCs reach your ship and cause significant damages. However, you make it out alive.
You then make you way to the next asset on this planet, located inside a small government building. Like the previous location the building is destroyed and surrounded by hundreds of Midas Creatures. You already are heavily damaged, making it even harder to get the next asset through the endless MCs. 
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

+ Attempt to collect the asset
-> AttemptAssetCollection2B
+ Dont collect it
-> DontCollectB

==AttemptAssetCollection2B==
You again prepare for battle all by yourself, launching an all out attack on the Midas Creatures, again blowing up an enitre side of the building to create a gap you can enter. You speed you way in, load the asset onto you ship, and get out of there. While successful, you sustain even more significant damages from the MCs. Your ship is in desparate need of repair, but you were able to collect both assets on this planet.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
-> END
==DontCollectB==
You fly away, determining it too risky to collect this one. Kellis' CEO might be satisfied with you bringing one asset back.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
-> END


==DontCollect==
You fly away from the warehouse and off to the next asset, determining it too risky to attempt to collect this one. You head over the next location, a small government building. On arrival, you see that the building is destroyed and surrounded by hundreds of Midas Creatures. Again, it will be incredibly difficult to break into the building. 
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

==AttemptAssetCollection2C==
You go into the chaos as a lone ship, Kuon leads the weapons team as they begin tearing down the walls of Midas Creatures. Eventually, you're able to create a gap. You enter the government building and quickly collect the asset inside. But not before many MCs reach your ship and cause significant damages. However, you make it out alive with the asset.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
-> END
==DontCollectC==
You fly away again, determining it too risky to collect the asset. Kellis' CEO will likely be upset you didn't collect more assets when you had the chance.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
