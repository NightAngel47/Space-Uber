Proximity to it transfigured the guards. It acted like radiation, but with a purpose, not affecting the surrounding plantlife, just the humans who got too close. Like the fabled Midas curse which turns anything to gold...\" The unease in Lanri’s always-focused eyes breaks through.","\n","^\"If I conduct some experiments on the Midas beast we captured I should be able to develop a cure to reverse the effects. However, the constant solar flares have also attracted my attention, and I fear they may be related.
