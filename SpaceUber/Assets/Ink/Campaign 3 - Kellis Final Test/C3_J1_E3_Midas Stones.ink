You're closing in on your next asset pickup, this time your target is a planet with considerably more atmosphere than the last. As you break the cloud layer you see farmland stretching for miles, massive automated arboretums, and a planetwide food production line that puts your hydroponics in perspective. 
You're hailed by the asset guard team on a local frequency, who requests every clearance code Dispatch gave you before they'll even disclose your landing zone.
Once you've been triple checked, the team informs you that several highly classified entities broke into the holding facility and took the asset, a high-yield solar catcher Kellis has been test running here. They've tracked the asset down, but given the situation were told to wait for backup, namely, you.
Your ship touches down between the unnaturally large trees of this planet. In front of you the asset team maintains its distance from a small scattershot of craters. 
At the center of each crater sits a scrap of a golden, semi-metallic material. And in the center of them all, with drag marks through the grass leading to it, is the sun catching machine, turned on its side.

Your security team forms a perimeter while the asset team signals to each other to move up. They avoid the craters and reach the sun catcher and signal back to your team the all clear. 
A voice sounds inside the ship's circuits, crushing your thoughts, "We have seen you before, slave/collector of tragedy." The asset team has fallen to the ground, their bodies straining against their skin as it yellows and deforms, something snaps and nearly skeletal arms breach out of their torsos, new skin rapidly generating over the limbs. 
Within seconds, the same golden creatures you encountered on Echo-28 are now glancing between the many guns pointed at them. The team opens fire and the creatures dive into the craters.

==Asset_Left==
You recall the security team, and ready the ship for takeoff. Again, a presence pushes against your synthetic mind, "We have seen your function, you cannot persist/serve." 
The corrupted beings crawl from the craters, each carrying a piece of golden scrap. They begin hurling the golden wreckage at your engines. They're targeting all the right places. 
The doors shut and your ship lurches forward, clipping one of the massive trees and careening upwards through the canopy. None of your crew were injured, but you lost Kellis' package.

->End_Scene

==Asset_Taken==
You instruct your security team to retreat back onto the ship, and ready your crew to man a cargo winch fast. The unknown voice again pushes against your synthetic mind, "You disregard our warning/promise, let us pay/instruct you." 
Your ship bursts upwards and hovers as hooks spool from the cargo bay and attach to the sun-catcher. The ship blasts upwards, twisting through the trees and ramming through the canopy. Only then do you detect the golden monsters that are crawling up the winches and invading the cargo bay. 
Your workers are slaughtered, Kuon only managing to arrive in time to stop the creatures from detaching the hooks from the sun-catcher. The asset is pulled aboard into a pool of blood. 
[Asset Recovered, -Crew]
-> End_Scene

==Fight==
You tell security to hold their ground. That same presence pushes against your synthetic mind, "You are committed/bound to death." 
The corrupted beings hurl the golden scrap from the craters they hide in, the broken pieces landing among your security perimeter, the men turn a sickly yellow and begin to crack, Kuon orders the survivors to fire on their comrades. 
As blood, threaded gold spills across the grass, your ship's cannons finally power on. The ship hovers upwards just enough to get an angle on the crouching creatures around the sun-catcher. The bombardment is brief, but efficient. 
You took heavy loses to your security team and ammo stores, but are able to hook the sun-catcher to a winch and pull away from the corrupted material. The asset is recovered.

==End_Scene==
As you fly back to Dispatch to report the situation, you realize that something has gotten onto the ship. One of the creatures is in your server room, your effective consciousness. It raises one of its powerful claws, which would bring you complete oblivion. Then it stops and stands there docile. "You are my mind, reforged." the voice spreads throughout your being. 
The monster stays there, non-hostile, at least to you. You decide not to mess with it for the time being. While flying you spot countless small lights on the horizon, wreckage superheating as it falls into the atmosphere. Every piece glows the same gold as the monster now in your ship.
If just a few pieces could threaten your entire ship, there’s no telling what a blanket rain across the planet could do. According to protocol, it’s not your job to think about it.
