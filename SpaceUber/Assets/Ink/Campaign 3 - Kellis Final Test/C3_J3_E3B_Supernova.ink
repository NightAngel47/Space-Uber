With a mega solar panel strong enough to contain a supernova functional, you get ready to put it into action. During these preparations, the voice contacts you again.
"Hello AI. I am glad I can finally reach you clearly. When Kellis awakened me, they intended to take over the entire universe. I cannot allow this. I must protect the sacredness of my history and this universe. Will you help me destroy those assets and stop Kellis from causing more harm?

"I'm glad we are on the same side. We will be in contact again soon." The artifact's voice then vanishes. You continue with the preparation for the solar panel, but you receive a transmission from an unknown source. 
"Hellooooo there AI! Thank you for answering. If you do not know, although surely you should, I am the CEO of Equinox. You could say were a bit a a rival to your friend Kellis. It seems that you are in somewhat of a pickle. Those golden creatures running around everywhere, huh? Well, I would like to offer you a solution. We have developed a cure ourselves for them! Isn't that fun? We'll even give it to you for free! We would just like it to be known to the universe that we Equinox stopped something Kellis couldn't. So what do ya say, wanna cure an entire solar system together?"

"Good... hahaha... I am glad you see the logic in this partnership. The cure shall be at your disposal within an hour". She thanks you and ends the transmission.
You quickly receive the cure as promised. First you fly to Avanshore's Star. You carefully place the massive solar panel in position and prepare for whatever happens. A few minutes later, Avanshore's star explodes. Once the supernova finishes its course. You get a new visual of Avenshore. Everything is fine, but you must now cure the Midas Creatures.
You head back to the planets to begin spreading Equinox's cure. You fly all over the solar system spreading massive amounts of the cure throughout the planets. You watch as the Midas Creatures turn back into humans. 
Once you are finished, everyone is a normal human again. You saved Avenshore! But, what will Kellis think now?
-> END

==DeclineHelpA==
"Your loss then. Even the damn AI is a Kellis loyalist" The transmission then abruptly cuts out.
You fly to Avanshore's Star. You carefully place the massive solar panel in position and prepare for whatever happens. A few minutes later, Avanshore's star explodes. Once the supernova finishes its course. You get a new visual of Avenshore. Everything is fine. Lanri's mega solar panel worked to perfection. You saved Avenshore! But actually, you didn't. It seems you forgot to fix the issue of the Midas Creatures. They now have the entire solar system at their feet. The citizens of Avanshore doomed.

"You will regret making an enemy of me." The artifact's voice then vanishes. You continue with the preparation for the cure, but you receive a transmission from an unknown source.

It seems that you are in a bit of a pickle. Imminent supernova gonna destroy you, huh? Well, I would like to offer you a solution. We have a Dyson Sphere technology that will contain the explosion. Isn't that fun? We'll even give it to you for free! We would just like it to be known to the universe that we Equinox stopped something Kellis couldn't.
