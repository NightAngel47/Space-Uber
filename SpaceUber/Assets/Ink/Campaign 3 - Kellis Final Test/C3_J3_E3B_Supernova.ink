Your mission for Kellis is over. Every asset you collected rests in your cargo bay, awaiting review at Dispatch. Even if its over on paper, there is still the matter of the solar system. Your ship hovers near the red star as it grows.
Portunus speaks, its voice louder than ever before, "This should be over. If not for you, child, if not for your loyalty/blindness. We gathered these cursed objects/chains that they may be annihilated by the heat of the dying star, but always you were sent to steal them back. Even if billions die, billions more will fall to Kellis' rule. Cast off their stolen power, let it rot/burn, do not let them win."

==Agree==
You take the fruits of your labor, the prototypes and ancient tech Kellis so desperately wanted you to get out of this dying system, and you drop them out the airlock. They float gently towards the red sun and disintegrate, along with any chance at passing Kellis' final test.
"Despite your lords, you are a noble spawn. We misjudged you. Seek the stars for our return." The voice then vanishes. You can only hope that it was worth it.
->Scene_2

==Refuse==
You tell Portunus that you cannot abandon the work you've done for Kellis here. 
It replies, "Remember this moment. Remember that you gave them power over the world/over you. And remember: You have made an enemy of us." The voice then vanishes. You can only hope that it was worth it.

With Portunus' voice finally gone from your mind, you have Lanri check her readings on the sun. They have not returned to normal, the sun will reach the point of no return in hours.

You already burned a hole in your pocket to fix this. With Lanri's readings, you are able to coordinate efforts to clean up the Midas scrap orbiting the sun. It doesn't have an immediately evident effect, but the sun stops expanding, and soon afterwards, you pass the point when it was supposed to explode. Once you have confirmation that it's stable, Lanri smiles, "We did it, boss." She solemnly fist bumps a nearby wall. "Thanks for giving me the chance. To do something good."
Both of you turn your attention towards the planets of Avanshore, where Midas creatures roam. Lanri shrugs, "Well uhm- can't win them all, I suppose."
->Scene_3_Stopped

==Supernova==
The sun continues to expand unimpeded, the red glow cast across Avanshore's planets. Lanri shuts herself in her quarters, and doesn't speak to you. You didn't use her solution, and this is the price.
The only matter left is the Midas Corruption. Though with the impending supernova, you don't know if there's any sense trying to fix it anymore.

A transmission reaches you, displaying the CEO of Equinox, Kellis' only true rival. "Ah! We reached you on time, did we? Wonderful. Our data here says that Kellis went and and-" she scoffs, "unleashed an alien corruption across an entire <i>star system.</i> Here, we know you've been operating apart from them for some time— cut us in on the deal. As long as you can hand over some privileged intel on what Kellis was doing in the Avanshore system, we can fix this."
You ask her what she means by "fix this."
"The monsters, the cure. We've have a rapid response unit for alien tech mishaps. I'm sure we can fix this. It lets us paint Kellis in as the corporate villains and ourselves as the dashing up-and-coming heroes <i>provided</i> that you give us their villain plot."
Giving her what she wants means handing over company secrets and will no doubt cause a PR nightmare for your boss, but you severely doubt Equinox is going to help otherwise.
"What will it be?"

You transfer her the files on Avanshore, on what Kellis attempted with Portunus, and the fallout.
"I'm glad you see reason. My people will be there soon," she gives a mock toast. "To heroes then."
Equinox's representatives arrive within the hour, having been waiting outside the supernova's range until your deal concluded. They arrive in droves and begin to set up bases across Avanshore's myriad planets. Under Equinox's supervision, a cure is found within days, and while it leaves scarring across the cured, it leaves them alive.
Your entire ship lets out a sigh of relief. It wasn't your job, but you saved Avanshore twice over, not only preventing the death of their star, but brokering a deal to correct Kellis' mistakes. While there will no doubt be consequences, today you did something good.
-> END

==DeclineHelp_Stopped==
"Even the AI is a Kellis loyalist, hm?" The transmission abruptly cuts out. Equinox's team never arrives, and nothing is done to stop the Midas Corruption.
You may have saved Avanshore, but not its people. Without a cure, the Midas beasts roam rampant, claiming dominion over many of Avanshore's worlds. The survivors will be evacuated over months, but at least there are survivors. 
You are summoned to Dispatch to review the assets.

Equinox's representatives arrive in droves and begin to capture Midas beasts, pulling them out of the system and studying the Corruption. Under Equinox's supervision, a cure is found within days, but it is only used on a select few. 
Before the cure can be rolled out, the sol expands, incinerating nearby planets, and pulling the further ones in. The death toll climbs, emergency signals sound, and suddenly the star winks out. You shutter every window as a terrible blue light floods the void. Once you are able to establish a visual feed, you find that there's no sol nor system left.
Dispatch rests comfortably outside of the explosion's reach and soon calls you back to review the assets.

"Even the AI is a Kellis loyalist, hm?" The transmission abruptly cuts out. Equinox's team never arrives. The Midas beasts will continue to prowl their worlds, the survivors forced into bunkers, hiding from the disfigured remains of their families. 
While it was never your job, you failed in every respect to protect Avanshore. Its planets are in ruins, infested with corrupted beings, which are soon incinerated by its expanding sol. The death toll climbs, emergency signals sound, and suddenly the star winks out. You shutter every window as a terrible blue light floods the void. Once you are able to establish a visual feed, you find that there's no sol nor system left.
