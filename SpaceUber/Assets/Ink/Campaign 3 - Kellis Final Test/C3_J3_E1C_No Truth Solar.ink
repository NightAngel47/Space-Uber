Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I have mastered the very cosmos!" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.
"The Supernova. It seems like it has everything to do with these golden obelisks we've been seeing. Those things seem to continuously produce energy, and the more the radiation they absorb from the sun the worse it gets. It's a feedback loop. Thankfully a lot of the scrap has been flung past Avanshore or to the planets below, but there's still a cloud of the stuff orbiting close to the sun. And the longer it sits there the worse this gets.  
"How it got there, I have no idea, but it can't have been for long given the sol's state. If we can clean it up, the problem at the very least won't get worse, and then it'll be a matter of siphoning off the excess energy so it doesn't hit its breaking point. Kellis should have proto-Dison tech to handle that part.
"Really the issue here is funds. We cannot singlehandedly clean up the cloud of irradiated scrap around the sol, but with enough money or convincing, Kellis scrappers could handle the lion's share.
"Given that this whole thing is a company secret they're the only ones we can turn to, but I mean, come on, Kellis isn't so evil that they'd let a solar system explode because they don't stand to gain." She stops to think about what she said, and grows more concerned.

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's point stands, if you don't intercede, Kellis likely won't do anything about it. You'll be paying out of pocket, the ship effectiveness and crew wages will suffer, but you doubt the crew would pass up an opportunity to be heroes like this.
You give Lanri the go ahead and she audibly screams before you mute the audio. She begins work on the project immediately.
-> END

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's point stands, if you don't intercede, Kellis likely won't do anything about it. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You send word to the CEO that you've managed to crack the solar anomalies, and with a loan, could even prevent them.
After an hour of deliberation you recieve approval for the plan to recover the scrap under the following conditions. The recovered material will fall into Kellis' posession, your team is barred from further research into the sun and the Midas Corruption, and your ship will recieve a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->END

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and simply must hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."
