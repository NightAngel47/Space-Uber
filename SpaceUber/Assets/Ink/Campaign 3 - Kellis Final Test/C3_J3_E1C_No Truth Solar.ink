Lanri contacts you, her shouting immediately drawing your attention. "I've got it! I have mastered the very cosmos!" You say nothing as Lanri catches her breath.
"The Supernova. It seems like it has everything to do with these golden obelisks we've been seeing. Those things seem to continuously produce energy, and the more the radiation they absorb from the sun the worse it gets. It's a feedback loop. Thankfully a lot of the scrap has been flung past Avanshore or to the planets below, but there's still a cloud of the stuff orbiting close to the sun. And the longer it sits there the worse this gets.  
"How it got there, I have no idea, but it can't have been for long given the sol's state. If we can clean it up, the problem at the very least won't get worse, and then it'll be a matter of siphoning off the excess energy so it doesn't hit its breaking point. Kellis should have proto-Dison tech to handle that part.
"Really the issue here is funds. We cannot singlehandedly clean up the cloud of irradiated scrap around the sol, but with enough money or convincing, Kellis scrappers could handle the lion's share.
"Given that this whole thing is a company secret they're the only ones we can turn to, but I mean, come on, Kellis isn't so evil that they'd let a solar system explode because they don't stand to gain." She stops to think about what she said, and grows more concerned.

*[Ask Kellis for a Favor]
-> Kellis_Fund

*[Do Not Stop the Supernova]

==Self_Fund==
Lanri's point stands, if you don't intercede, Kellis likely won't do anything about it. You'll be paying out of pocket, the ship effectiveness and crew wages will suffer, but you doubt the crew would pass up an opportunity to be heroes like this.
You give Lanri the go ahead and she audibly screams before you mute the audio. She begins work on the project immediately.
->Conspiracy

==Kellis_Fund==
Lanri's point stands, if you don't intercede, Kellis likely won't do anything about it. But you don't have the money to handle it alone right now. You send word to the CEO that you've managed to crack the solar anomalies, and with a loan, could even prevent them.
After an hour of deliberation you recieve approval for the plan to recover the scrap under the following conditions. The recovered material will fall into Kellis' posession, your team is barred from further research into the sun and the Midas Corruption, and your ship will recieve a substantial pay cut for this job.
Lanri, unable to contain her excitement, begins work right away.
->Conspiracy

==No_Fund==
You cannot spare the time or money on one of Lanri's plans, not when the situation in Avanshore is so precarious already. You have your orders from Kellis, and simply must hope that they understand the bigger picture here.
You tell Lanri no. She makes a pun about how you can't spell fun without funding, which is objectively wrong. She continues accosting you for the money until she realizes that you've made your final decision. She looks over her days of research and mumbles, "I guess I should've known..."

==Conspiracy==
Shortly after your talk with Lanri, you again arrive at Dispatch. The CEO seems to have learned from the previous encounter, and summons Kuon and you rather than Captain Lexa to debrief with. The place seems completely at peace, despite the tragedy unfolding outside it. Men in suits sit at balconies and sip coffee, secretaries rush across the unnaturally wide atriums. Kuon steps into the elevator.
You arrive at the CEO's barren and imposing office. Through the window in back you can see Avanshore's sun glowing a soft red. The Kellis headman sits facing you, awaiting your return.
He claps his hands together. "Wonderful job so far!" he says.
"Sir?" Kuon asks.
"Not you. Your captain. The one who, if proven useful, will signal a new age in corporate competition, and whose failure shows that the world no longer needs us." he looks tired, but there's a red shine to his eyes. "From what I heard, you've kept a lid on things so far, despite your extracurricular research. It's nice to have an employee that listens to me for once." 
"But things are only going to get more complicated from here. You need to know that Kellis is culpable. The solar flares, the monsters running around out there." he swings his arm to gesture at Avanshore, "If the world knew, we'd be tied to this dying star with red tape. But as long as we play this smart, we can get something useful out of this."
Kuon speaks, "Sir, if you may clarify."
He nods, "We were trying to do something useful. We found an alien ship, undamaged, a little over a century ago now. Designation: Portunus. We were able to take measurements, readings, access its data, and the few drops we got changed everything. High yield weapons, advanced forcefields" he pauses and gives you a look as if trying to gauge reaction, "and even Artificial Intelligence schematics that we were able to apply halfway decently.
"But Portunus was capable of so much more, it was drained of power, had been dead in the water for eons. We lugged it to a nearby star and used our scavenged alien tech to try to wake it up. Do you know what we could have done with that power? Equinox would be an afterthought. 
"It would've propelled us into a new age. The sun catcher dipped into Avanshore's sol and jump-started Portunus, but apparently the entire artifact was its own sort of power source. The material it's built out of has endless applications..." he trails off. 
"The feedback caused an explosion that propelled that material across the galaxy, to... debilitating effect. And it also sent Avanshore's sol on a path toward's supernova."
"The assets you've been picking up are prototypes, replacement pieces, the data required to get a handle on Portunus once we find it again, to handle its power surges. If you let the assets get wiped out by this thing" he points to the red sun, "All this will be for nothing."
After a pause the CEO splays his hands out in front of you, "So, now that everything is out in the open, can I trust you to finish the job?"

*[Yes, I will finish the job]
-> Loyalty
*[No, you're a monster]
-> Rebellion

==Loyalty==
You speak, "I will complete the objective. My faith in Kellis is unshakable." 
The CEO's eyes show relief more than anything, "Thank you. And you," he points to Kuon. "You have done much better than the last one. You're on the short list for a promotion."
Kuon stares for a moment, "But sir, I hardly spoke."
Your boss smiles, "Exactly. You're both dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves, his reaction time serving well to make you both scarce. He congratulates himself and you on your negotiation, despite how little of it either of you did. You approach the docking bay, back in Kellis' good graces. As long as the job is done.
->END

==Rebellion==
You speak, "You have listed every crime Kellis has commited against Avanshore. And all you ask is for me to enable you to repeat these crimes until you can reign in the power of this ancient intelligence? I will not serve a monster, nor will I hand it the keys to the destruction of worlds."
The CEO stares back at you and blinks, finally caught off guard. 
Kuon fills the silence, "What the hell are you doing." you sense he is speaking to you. "Kellis is the only one posed to fix this galaxy, why would a creature of reason stand against them?"
The CEO regains his composure and his rage, "You will finish the mission. If you fail the AI branch will be severed from the company and your ship will be taken into custody, it will be incinerated, along with your intelligence, the crew, and any record of your existence." he thinks for a moment, "I will grant amnesty to your Security Officer here, for he at least seems to be a creature of reason. You are dismissed."
Kuon stands and leaves before you can get another word in. He is silent during the walk back. In your experience, Kuon only goes silent when he needs to make a point, or ready himself for combat. You pray it is the former.
