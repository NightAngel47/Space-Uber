{"inkVersion":19,"root":[["^Your crew has come together away from the prying eyes of their corporate overlords, and has asked that you observe. Lexa and Kuon sit opposite of one another, Ripley and Lanri to their flanks, with Mateo lounging in the background.","\n","^Given the attitudes of much of this group, this meeting was inevitable.","\n","^Lexa starts, \"We need to talk about what to do with these people on our ship.\"","\n","^\"You speak of the hand that feeds you with a bite in your voice.\" Kuon says.","\n","^Lexa rolls her eyes, \"Kuon, we've done this once before. You trusted me on this before.\"","\n","^His hand instinctively reaches to his cybernetic face, \"Things change. And Kellis is poised to do good things.\"","\n","^\"Then why haven't they?\" Lexa answers back. \"Is it because of us?\" she points to your camera, \"Them? Or is it the people on top who refuse to care about what happens? We have to do something.\"","\n","^Lanri nods vigorously, \"A chance like this won't come twice. In fact, it's likely that it will never come again. Crews like us will be rendered obsolete in days, not years, so we would have to trust the world to Kellis and whatever they do to our captain.\"","\n","^Ripley regards the room, \"We stand on a precipice. That much is clear. The smallest motion on this ship could cascade to the destruction of worlds.\" The eyes in the room drift towards Mateo, who hasn't spoken.","\n","^Noticing their attention, Mateo nods as if everyone has just made very good points and gives a thumbs up. \"Sorry, didn't get a lot of sleep last night, but I totally agree, let's destroy Kellis from the inside!\"","\n","^Kuon pushes to his feet, \"We are not discussing sabotage and mutiny again! Do you not see how much you owe this company?\"","\n","^Mateo frowns, \"I am oh so grateful that Kellis turned my planet into a work camp where everyone was paid in company credit. Is that what you want me to say?\"","\n","^\"No, I- that wasn't ideal-\" Kuon falters and Lexa steps in.","\n","^\"We're the only ones who can make it ideal, Kuon. And this is the only chance we have. My plan isn't too elegant, but I say we kill them, mess with their clone backups somehow, cut off the head of the snake.\"","\n","^Lanri raises her hand excitedly, \"Oo oo! Speaking of clones, we could do that. Clone the CEO, port our captain into the clone, and then they can fix everything! I would just need Ripley's help to do it.\"","\n","^Ripley rolls her eyes at Lanri's enthusiasm and agrees.","\n","^Mateo, in a thinker pose says, \"Well hey, we can always go through with their plan, mass produce the Rustbucket. I could just make sure that none of their personality is lost, so that way they can stop delivering packages, collapse the economy, or just make sure Kellis stops their typical bullshit policy.\"","\n","^Kuon sighs, \"Fine. Then I will forward my own proposition. We leave them alive. We don't follow up on your insane plans, and we all earn a valuable promotion. From there we stay on good behavior and make sure the company is run in a way that satisfies everyone.\"","\n","^Ripley shakes her head, \"It would never work. The strength of one man is too little.\"","\n","^Kuon winces, \"Well what about us five? Counting the captain that's six. I'm not going to watch you all press us back into the dark ages. There has to be something less extreme.\" After Kuon speaks the rest of the table is silent aside from Mateo throwing in some jokes to break the tension.","\n","^Lexa looks around, \"I'd say anyone's plan here shows promise, save but one,\" she glances towards the security officer, \"Do you think you could throw your weight behind any of these plans?\"","\n","ev","str","^Lexa's Plan: Assassination","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Lanri and Ripley's Plan: Replace CEO","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Mateo's Plan: Courier Hive Mind","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":20},"ev","str","^Kuon's Plan: Work Within Kellis","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-3","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Assassination"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"Clone"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["\n",{"->":"Hive_Mind"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-3":["\n",{"->":"Loyalty"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Assassination":["^You let Lexa know that you support her plan.
