This planet is being completely overrun by the Midas Creatures. You are contacted by a group of the Solar system's governments, and they'll help you collect the two remaining assets on this planet. You first head to an old warehouse, surrounded by MCs. It almost seems impossible to get into the warehouse. Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

+ [Attempt to collect the asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollectionA
+ [Don't collect it]
-> DontCollectA

==AttemptAssetCollectionA==
Right before you head in, a few other ships arrive at the scene. They communicate to you that they are with the government and here to assist you however needed. With the help of the fleet, you descend to the warehouse. You and the ally fleet begin tearing down the walls of Midas Creatures. Once you create a gap, you enter the warehouse and quickly collect the asset inside. But not before a couple MCs reach your ship and cause some damages. However, you make it out before anything worse can happen to you. Although a few of your ally ships have been destroyed while you were inside the warehouse.
You then make your way to the next asset on this planet, located inside a small government building. Like the previous location the building is destroyed and surrounded by hundreds of Midas Creatures. The ally ships are still with you, but there are significantly less than when they first joined you. Making it even harder to get the next asset. 
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

+ [Attempt to collect the asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollection2B
+ [Dont collect it]
-> DontCollectB

==AttemptAssetCollection2B==
With the help of the government's ships, you again launch an all out attack on the Midas Creatures, again blowing up an entire side of the building to create a gap you can enter. You speed your way in, load the asset onto your ship, and get out of there. While successful, you sustain even more damages from some MCs. Your ship is in desperate need of repair, but you were able to collect both assets on this planet.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
-> END

==DontCollectB==
You fly away, determining it too risky to collect this one. Kellis' CEO might be satisfied with you bringing one asset back.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
-> END


==DontCollectA==
You fly away from the warehouse and off to the next asset, determining it too risky to attempt to collect this one. You head over the next location, a small government building. On arrival, you see that the building is destroyed and surrounded by hundreds of Midas Creatures. Again, it will be incredibly difficult to break into the building. 
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?

+ [Attempt to collect the asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollection2C
+ [Don't collect it]
-> DontCollectC

==AttemptAssetCollection2C==
Right before you head in, a few other ships arrive at the scene. They communicate to you that they are with the government and here to assist you however needed. With the help of the fleet, you descend down to the destroyed building. You and the ally fleet begin tearing down the walls of Midas Creatures. Once you create a gap, you enter the building and quickly collect the asset inside. But not before a couple MCs reach your ship and cause some damages. 
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
-> END
==DontCollectC==
You fly away again, determining it too risky to collect the asset. Kellis' CEO will likely be upset you didn't collect more assets when you had the chance.
Lanri again contacts you. "Boss, the solution is ready. I'll make the preparation to out it into action. We can finally save the people!"
