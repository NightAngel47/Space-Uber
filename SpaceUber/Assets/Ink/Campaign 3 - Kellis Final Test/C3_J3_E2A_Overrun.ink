While the rain of golden obelisks has slowed across Avanshore, your target planet is close to the sun and has been ravaged by wildfires, crippling its defenses and allowing the Midas creatures to take complete control. All that remains are ruins, monsters, and, of course, two assets Kellis wants found immediately.  
The Avanshore government is willing to lend their aid, given the goodwill you've fostered and two government ships are prepared to assist you. Their preliminary scans lock in on an asset in a leaning skyscraper; It is absolutely crawling with Midas creatures.
The voice of Portunus crackles across your brain, "This is what you/your lords have wrought/ensured. Leave this final/regrettable tomb. What you fetch only perpetuates our struggle."
Do you proceed?

+ [Fight for the Asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollectionA
+ [Don't Collect the Asset]
-> DontCollectA

==AttemptAssetCollectionA==
With the help of the fleet, you tear down walls of Midas creatures who can only throw rocks back in your direction. Eventually, though, you need to move in to secure the asset. Once you enter their effective range, Midas beasts come out of the woodwork to rip apart your ship. While you only need a few seconds to grab the asset, it's enough time for them to deal significant damage to you.
->Scene_2

==DontCollectA==
You fly away from the skyscraper and off to the next asset, determining it too risky. 
->Scene_2

==Scene_2==
The other asset is located within the half-buried remains of subway tunnels. You can expect another horde of Midas creatures, this time at close quarters. One allied ships is still with you and has its own troops, but your loss of the other will make this far more difficult. 
Do you still want to try to collect the asset?
+ [Attempt to collect the asset]
-> AttemptAssetCollection2B
+ [Dont collect it]
-> DontCollectB

==AttemptAssetCollection2B==
With the help of the government ships, you launch an all out attack, bombing the tunnels and sending your security team in before the Midas beasts can recover. You lay down covering fire for several minutes, hoping to draw the monsters' attention away from the small squad fighting through the underground. As soon as the away team radios for pickup you swoop down to to find them, missing many of their members, but bearing the asset. You rush them aboard and flee the doomed planet.
The ships wish you luck, not even realizing what the assets you just collected are.
-> END

==DontCollectB==
You fly away, determining it too risky to collect this one. Kellis' CEO might not be satisfied with this choice, but it is clear that the price for another asset is too high. You leave the doomed planet behind you
-> END
