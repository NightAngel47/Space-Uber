It has everything to do with the golden obelisks. Those things seem to continuously produce energy, and the more radiation they absorb from the sun the worse it gets. Thankfully a lot of the scrap has been flung past Avanshore or to the planets below, but there's still a cloud of alien scrap orbiting close to the sun. The longer it sits there the worse this gets.","\n","^\"How it got there, I have no idea, but it can't have been for long given the sol's state. If we can clean it up, the problem at the very least won't get worse. Then we can work on long term solutions.","\n","^\"Really the issue here is funds. We cannot singlehandedly clean up the cloud of irradiated scrap around the sol, but with enough money or convincing, Kellis scrappers could handle the lion's share.","\n","^\"Given that this whole thing is a company secret they're the only ones we can turn to, but I mean, come on, Kellis isn't so evil that they'd let a solar system explode because they don't stand to gain, right?\" She stops to think about what she said, and grows more concerned.","\n","ev","str","^Fund the Sol Siphon","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Ask Kellis for a Favor","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Do Not Stop the Supernova","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Self_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"Kellis_Fund"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Self_Fund":["^Lanri's point stands, if you don't intercede, Kellis likely won't do anything about it.
