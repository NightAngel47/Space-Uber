You've been summoned back to Dispatch for another performance review. Avanshore's sun has made no visible sign to its citizens that something is wrong, and neither have you. 
The next few weeks could be used to evacuate a small portion of the citizens, but Kellis is increasingly insistent that the assets are recovered. They are reeling you back to HQ, likely to address this and hopefully to give guidance on how to proceed.
