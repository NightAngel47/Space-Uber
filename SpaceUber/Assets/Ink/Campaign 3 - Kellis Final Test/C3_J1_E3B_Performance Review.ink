Your arrive at Kellis local headquarters. Somewhere between a space station and a mobile fortress, it is known colloquially as "Dispatch." As the ship locks into the auto-docking rail, Lexa and you are summoned to your performance review. You are expected to view through her suit cam.
Dispatch resembles a skyscraper in many ways, the architecture wrapping around several massive atriums, populated by sleek elevator bays and glass balconies. Maintenance hallways are placed at intervals throughout the station, leading past ductwork to crew quarters and gundecks that no one wants to see. Lexa passes by all this and heads straight to the top.
The CEO's office is much in the same style as the rest of the station, a black marble floor, a glass wall looking out at the Avanshore system, and bodyguards tucked into the shadows of the room, as if they spoil the decor.
A man who has been in his prime for the last three centuries stands across the table from Lexa. He is the acting CEO of Kellis, and will be until the funding for his designer clones dries up.
"Crew Manager." he says, referring to Lexa's formal title, "Your replacement has exceeded you in our metrics. Statistics and timetables are only so reliable though . What have you observed?"
Lexa clears her throat, "They’re certainly more your speed."
"Oh?" the suit chuckles, "For a moment there I forgot why you were being phased out."
Lexa takes the insult without hitting back.
"How about the latest two missions then?" the Kellis head starts, likely downloading the mission brief as he speaks. He frowns, "So, it prioritizing a few men over the mission objective that was right in front of it, is that what you consider 'our speed,' Crew Manager?"
"They’re still people, that isn’t even a choice."
"And I paid them to protect that asset with their lives. What about 'a job' is so difficult for you to understand?" the executive gestures as though he is explaining economics to a child.
"Just because I work for you doesn’t mean I stop being a person." Lexa replies.
"People like you are why we can't stomp down the competition." the CEO complains to himself, "If you serve the company's plan, we can do things none of you could do on your own. Good things." he lowers his head, "But we need you to work with us."
"You've had the money for years, I'll lay down my life for your profits once you do something useful with them."
The man laughs, and comments halfheartedly about Lexa being a firebrand. After a moment he sighs and his implants light up. "No, laughing that off didn’t really work. Will you need her?" your boss is speaking directly to you via implant, Lexa left out of the loop. "Once this mission is over, do you need this woman alive?"

-> Lexa_Doomed

==Lexa_Living==
You tell the boss that the hands-on experience of the former captain has been essential and will continue to be even as you move into the mass-production phase. Your explanation quickly becomes a defense of the entire human element of your ship’s chain of command, you citing Lanhri, Mateo, Kuon, and Ripley as other essential perspectives to do your job. 
Your measured response gives the man much needed time to cool and by the end he laughs, “Alright, no more, no more. I will recall this talk when the board and I discuss the human element in a few weeks. Thank you.”
To Lexa, this conversation isn't happening, and she continues to jab the CEO every couple seconds he stands there, not speaking.

==Lexa_Doomed==
You tell the boss that most arguments Lexa and the rest of your crew makes are easy to anticipate, and wouldn’t be very useful once you move into the mass-production phase. Your explanation is quickly extrapolated to a criticism of the entire human element of your ship’s chain of command.
The man smiles coldly at the end of your response, “Thank you, now at least I know what happens to her once this is over. And I’m sure the board will be interested in your ideas when we meet over the human element in a few weeks.”
To Lexa, this conversation isn't happening, and she continues to jab the CEO every couple seconds he stands there, not speaking.

The man ignores Lexa as he directs the final orders of business to you, "Moving on, you did fail to bring in the asset as requested, so your ship will be receiving a substantial pay cut. I’m sure you understand. And, of course, if that is more due to your own crew's incompetence, simply give me their names and I'll handle it."
The CEO claps his hands together and speaks outloud again, "Alright! Sent you the clearance codes you'll need. That should be everything sorted, I'm glad to be working with a professional." he turns to Lexa, "You are dismissed."
Lexa sits still, "Sir, what about the anomalies during our job?"
"Ah right, the gold beasts. You are to keep their existence secret. Thankfully, Echo-28 can be cleansed soon enough, we practically own the place. The rest of the planets will take some doing."
Lexa visibly twitches, "I meant what about us having to fight them. Those things are dangerous. Can we expect further interference from them?"
"They're mindless, the fact that you've encountered them twice is only due to their pervasiveness."
You recall the voice which echoed across your circuits and the 'beast' still confined in your ship.

*[Keep the Voice Hidden]
You mention nothing, Lexa comments that she hopes its coincidence, and you are dismissed.
->Scene_3

==CEO_Worry==
You inform your boss that while the creatures and your crew fought, you felt something interfacing directly with your mind. The CEO had already dismissed you both, and was halfway into another brief, scheduling another meeting, but you briefly spot something human: Fear. 
"I'll make sure you get some of my men added to your security detail." he says, "You can expect resistance on your next asset recovery. And if that thing speaks to you again, don't listen to it. <i>You are dismissed.</i>" You leave.

==Scene_3==
Lexa returns to the ship in relative silence, but seems to grow more animated the closer to the ship she gets, "I'm guessing he started talking to you at the end there? Well. I'm not dead so it looks like you have my back. Thanks for that." 

Kellis wants you to pick up the next asset ASAP, so within an hour of docking, you again take off.
