You arrive at Kellis local headquarters, known colloquially as "Dispatch." Dispatch resembles a skyscraper in many ways, the architecture wrapping around several massive atriums, populated by sleek elevator bays and glass balconies. As the ship docks, Lexa and you are summoned to your performance review. You are expected to view through her suit cam.
The CEO's office is almost entirely black marble, with a glass wall looking out at the Avanshore system. A man who has been in his prime for the last three centuries stands across the table from Lexa.
"Crew Manager." the CEO says, referring to Lexa's formal title, "Your replacement has exceeded you in our metrics. What have you observed?"
Lexa clears her throat, "They’re certainly more your speed."
The suit chuckles, "For a moment there I forgot why you were being phased out."
Lexa takes the insult without hitting back.
"How about the latest two missions then?" the Kellis head starts, likely downloading the mission brief as he speaks. "It's doing its job, is that what you consider 'our speed?"
"There were people down there, they worked for you."
"And I paid them to protect that asset with their lives. What about 'a job' is so difficult to understand?" the executive gestures as though he is explaining economics to a child.
"Just because I work for you doesn’t mean I stop being a person," Lexa replies.
"If you serve the company's plan, we can do things none of you could do on your own. Good things." 
"You've had the money for years, I'll lay down my life for your profits once you do something useful with them."
After a moment, the man sighs and his implants light up. "Will you need her?" your boss is speaking directly to you via implant, Lexa left out of the loop. "Once this mission is over, do you need this woman alive?"

-> Lexa_Doomed

==Lexa_Living==
You tell the boss that the hands-on experience of the former captain has been essential and will continue to be even as you move into the mass-production phase. Your explanation quickly becomes a defense of all your human employees, you citing Lanri, Mateo, Kuon, and Ripley as other essential perspectives to your job. 
Your measured response gives the man much needed time to cool and by the end he laughs, "Alright, no more, no more. I will recall this talk when the board and I discuss the human element in a few weeks. Thank you."
To Lexa, this conversation isn't happening, and she continues to jab the CEO every couple seconds he stands there, not speaking.
->Scene_2

==Lexa_Doomed==
You tell the boss that most arguments Lexa and the rest of your crew make are easy to anticipate, and wouldn't be very useful once you move into the mass-production phase. Your explanation is quickly extrapolated to a criticism of human employees.
The man smiles coldly at the end of your response, "Thank you, now at least I know what happens to her once this is over. And I'm sure the board will be interested in your ideas when we meet over the human element in a few weeks."
To Lexa, this conversation isn't happening, and she continues to jab the CEO every couple seconds he stands there, not speaking.

==Scene_2
The man ignores Lexa as he directs the final orders of business to you, "Moving on, as you handled the two asset pickups optimally given an unexpected situation, you will be receiving a bonus. Spend it wisely. And, of course, let me know if any of the rest of your crew starts acting like your middle manager here."
The CEO claps his hands together and speaks outloud again, "Alright! That should be everything sorted, I'm glad to be working with a professional." he turns to Lexa, "You are dismissed."
Lexa sits still, "Sir, what about the anomalies during our job?"
"Ah right, the gold beasts. You are to keep their existence secret. Thankfully, Echo-28 can be cleansed soon enough."
Lexa visibly twitches, "I meant what about us having to fight them. Can we expect further interference?"
"They're mindless, the fact that you've encountered them twice is only due to their pervasiveness."
You recall the voice which echoed across your circuits and the 'beast' still confined in your ship.

->CEO_Worry
*[Keep the Voice Hidden]
You mention nothing, Lexa comments sharply that she hopes it's coincidence, and you are dismissed.
->Scene_3

==CEO_Worry==
You inform your boss that while the creatures and your crew fought, you felt something interfacing directly with your mind. The CEO had already dismissed you both, and was halfway into scheduling another meeting, but you briefly spot something human: Fear. 
"I'll make sure you get some of my men added to your security detail." he says, "You can expect resistance on your next asset recovery. And if that thing speaks to you again, don't listen to it. <i>You are dismissed.</i>" You leave.

==Scene_3==
Lexa returns to the ship in relative silence, but seems to grow more animated the closer to the ship she gets, "I'm guessing he started talking to you at the end there? Well, I'm not dead so it looks like you have my back. Thanks for that." 

Kellis wants you to pick up the next asset ASAP, so within an hour of docking, you again take off.
