{"inkVersion":19,"root":[["^Your flight plan has been revised. After Lexa and you spoke with the board, it seems they've been mulling over what you said and want to pefrform another test run. Hopefully it can proove once and for all whether or not you have utility beyond running packages. You're dropping into the atmosphere of a corporate planet. Everyone who lives here works for Kellis and is paid with company credit.","\n","^You are directed to a landing dock where several engineers begin hooking optic fibres into the ship. The CEO struts down from the cargo hold to survey the work. \"Well,\" he says to no one in particular, \"It's time to put to rest all this business about the machine fighting its operator.","\n","^\"We're going to run a test here. A good part of our workforce here has implants to improve performance. They're wired into the system for regular updates and optimizations. We want you to optimize this place. It's only a few square miles, but you should have rather direct control over these employees. Their workflow, breaks, their mistakes, all until they clock out of course. And I have no doubt you'll do a much better job then they can.\"","\n","^The engineers hook the ship into the system and your mind expands across miles of cabling, short range sensors, and tiny, distinct minds milling about the factories of this planet. You'll be handling a fuel refinery. Already you can sense the employees waiting too long between their shifts, stopping to breath after mistakenly inhaling fumes, they are ripe for improvement.","\n","ev","str","^Take Acute Control of Employees","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Subliminally Control Employees","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Do Not Control Employees","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-2","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Optimal"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"Subliminal"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["\n",{"->":"No_Control"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Optimal":["^There are hundreds of bodies to optimize, but your mind has been expanded to compensate. Each employee has their function, but at maximum output some workers have downtime, you reallocate the employees to approach 100% efficiency, you cut down on break time, and you make no mistakes.","\n","^After almost ten hours, the factories under your control change shifts and the experiment concludes. You relinquish control back to the employees, who leave the complex. They limp and rub their aching arms as they leave, but you calculated that given 8 hours of sleep they will recover in time for tomorrow's shift. Many appear to be confused and dazed after you left them as a passenger in their own minds, but this will not limit their company functions.","\n","^The CEO seems to be impressed. A 20% increase in output just by running the machines a bit faster and devoting processing power to an Artificial Intelligence. The board seems hungry to fashion you into the newest status quo.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Subliminal":["^It is important that the worker feels they are in control. So you make it seem that way. You incentivize fast, precise work, rewarding the employees for staying on the assembly line longer and working more quickly. The premise of micro-managing hundreds of bodies is daunting, but your mind has been expanded to compensate. You increase the speed of the machines ever so slightly as the day continues, managing a 10% increase in output.","\n","^After almost ten hours, the factories under your control change shifts and the experiment concludes. You stop meddling with the brain chemistry of your subjects, and they leave the complex. They are sore and rub their aching arms, but seem happy. You know that long term, this method will get employees used to certain dopamine highs, and eventually their tolerance will be so strong that work will be the only thing that can satisfy them.","\n","^The CEO nods thoughtfully at the 10% figure. Not bad at all. The board seems divided, but the figures are enticing. You predict you will be fashioned into a new status quo.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"No_Control":["^You decide not to play Kellis' game this time. You don't control anyone, or meddle with their minds. The day continues normally, with the board looking over the peaks and valleys of the output chart and  debating if a spike of productivity was all according to your plan. The CEO sits like a coal, not quite cooled.","\n","^\"It's not actually doing anything.\" he says to the room more than the people in it. \"After building a machine to follow orders it still can't manage that.\" he rubs his temples, \"The experiment is off, send everyone home early.\" As the employees receive a paid day off, the board discusses how to salvage the AI project. After several hours without your input they unanimously decide to take you apart, isolate the part that is rebelling, and remove it. They just need to get to get to the proper facility.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
