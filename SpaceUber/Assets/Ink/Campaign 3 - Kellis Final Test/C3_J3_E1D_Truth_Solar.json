The longer it sits there the worse this gets.","\n","^\"How it got there, I have no idea, but it can't have been for long given the sol's state. If we can clean it up, the problem at the very least won't get worse. Then we can work on long term solutions.","\n","^\"Really the issue here is funds. We cannot singlehandedly clean up the cloud of irradiated scrap around the sol, but with enough money or convincing, Kellis scrappers could handle the lion's share.","\n","^\"Given that it directly affects them, we could ask the citizens of Avanshore, though Kellis is also an option.
