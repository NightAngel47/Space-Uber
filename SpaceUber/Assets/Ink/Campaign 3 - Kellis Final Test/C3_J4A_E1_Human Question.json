Captains like you are no longer necessary, that much is clear.\"","\n","^\"I'm glad you've found employees that can't talk back.\" Lexa says.","\n","^Your boss laughs, \"Well. Yes. Most don't have the mouth you do. We have a plan up here, you are simply too far down to see it.\" The board nods their heads in tandem.","\n","^\"It won't work. Ridding Kellis of dissenting voices, using an AI you don't have to pay, making a person who won't hold you accountable. You haven't seen it in action, it's more like us than you think.\"","\n","^The CEO cocks his head, \"Then we'll make changes. If we get rid of influences like you and strengthen protocol, this thing is fixable. Captains like you, on the other hand, are a liability.”","\n","^The door to the conference room opens, revealing the soiled garb of an engineer. Mateo shuffles forward with a smile. \"Hey! Do any of you know how to fix the coffee machine?\" The CEO stares as his eye implants try to inform him who Mateo is.","\n","^\"Well if you guys don't know, I guess we'll be going without it for the voyage. He Lexa, we need to get going.\"","\n","^You know now Mateo has also been marked for termination.

The face of Kellis notices this and gives an overbearing grin. \"You've obviously given us a lot to think about! Leave us.\"","\n","^Mateo and Lexa leave the room, Lexa trying to apologize all the while. Mateo laughs, \"At least now we know that even a little engineer can piss them off.
