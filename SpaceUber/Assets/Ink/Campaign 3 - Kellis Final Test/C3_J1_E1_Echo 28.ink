You approach your first pickup point: A moon orbiting the system's largest gas giant. It doesn't have a name so much as a designation, Echo 28, being too small and costly to terraform. It only supports a handful of remote Kellis vaults and military listening posts.
Your stabilizers flare and the ship touches down on the landing pad, but you find the no cargo nor greeting party. Instead the large blast doors of the vault stand open, a black maw against the empty lunar dunes.
Kuon assembles a search and rescue party within minutes, each equipping EVA gear to survive the nearly nonexistent atmosphere. The team heads in, with Kuon acting as commander.
Past the cargo bay are the base's airlocks, torn apart, and its crew quarters, whose occupants haven't done well without oxygen. Beyond another defensive perimeter, the team enters a massive underground storeroom with floor-to-ceiling storage shelves. Honing in on a light deeper the team converges on a central sorting area.
The surviving vault guards, each wearing their own EVA gear, crouch around a black cargo container, apparently waiting for you. Kuon immediately readies the cargo for extraction while the survivors try to explain what broke into the base, how it retreated mere minutes prior.
At this point your video feed distorts and a crowd of multi-limbed creatures stalk forth from the endless shelves. They are humanoid, but only in the broadest sense, riddled with tumors and lacking obvious features like eyes or mouths, each of them glowing a sickly gold color. They pounce on your team, what do you save?

== Guards_Left ==
You remind Kuon of the objective. His voice rings out over the team's radio channel, parroting your orders, "Secure the asset, ditch the guards." 
As the creatures rush forward, Kuon brings up a metal leg and kicks the asset back the way they came, the box skidding all the way into the previous room thanks to the lunar gravity. The security team immediately peels back,firing behind itself as it follows Kuon's path. 
The Kellis vault guards have no time to process the betrayal, quickly becoming proof of the monsters' strength and the weakness of human bones. 
The team tears back to the ship, their efforts illuminated by the occasional muzzle flash and the soft golden glow of the figures chasing them.

== Asset_Left ==
You tell Kuon to save the survivors. You hear a sigh before his voice rings out over the team's radio channel. "Ditch the asset, prioritize the survivors." 
With great force he grabs the guards closest to the monsters and flings them back towards the ship, spinning and kicking a lunging creature square in the chest. The security team forms a protective shield around the remaining survivors and peels back, firing behind itself as it follows Kuon's path. 
The asset is completely overrun, the creatures denting the box with each footfall as they crawl over it. The team tears back to the ship, their efforts illuminated by the occasional muzzle flash and the soft golden glow of the figures chasing them.
-> Scene_2

== Security_Left ==
You tell Kuon to buy time to save both. He processes your orders silently before bringing up a metal leg and kicking the asset back towards the ship and shoving two survivors with it. 
"Defend our retreat." He says, his voice hollow. The security team crouches and begins to fire at the surrounding horde, covering the tight corners. After a few seconds they become proof of the monsters' strength and the weakness of human bones, but it is enough time. 
Each of the vault guards grabs a corner of the cargo container and rushes towards the exit, with Kuon bringing up the rear. Between exact shots from his handgun and strong kicks to the ones that get too close, he gets them both back.

== Scene_2 ==
Kuon climbs back aboard, with the golden creatures in pursuit. They're faster than anticipated and will reach you before the engines are powered up. You need a few more seconds to escape.

==Security_Escape==
You rush the security team to the cargo hold to establish a firing line. Kuon asserts himself as the line's core through sheer force of violence, dispensing of anything within 10 meters of himself in seconds, and barking orders whenever the pursuers get past his reach. 
The engines heat as the wave of golden creatures pushes a few strides closer, Kuon conceding ground even amidst his series of executions. As the cargo doors ratchet closed, a few monsters break through the line, tackling your gunman to the ground, mouths opening on their chests and skulls. The security team whirls around and their steady hail of gunfire on the approaching wave stops. 
The ship blasts upwards as it is struck with the full force of their attack. The cargo bay nearly massacred if not for Kuon's intervention. You escaped, but at a heavy cost.
->END

==Weapon_Escape==
You call for battle stations, the ship's exterior turrets whirling to life. Blue lines cut across the lunar surface and slice decisively across the golden wave rushing towards you. 
Your external sensors are quickly confounded by the dust and ice kicked up from the shots. Without a good enemy count or understanding of their durability, the gunners have no choice but to continue firing into the cloud wherever the enemy might be, wasting crucial ammo. 
Kuon's suit cam shows him fending off the monstrous stragglers from the cargo bay, many missing limbs or heads from the random firing. The ship blasts upwards, the engines clearing the cloud of dust and revealing the horde, prowling over the corpses of the fallen, and staring eyelessly at your ship's departure.
-> END

==Food_Escape==
You jettison the ship's rations onto the lunar surface, telling Kuon to remain on standby in case the gamble doesn't pay off. 
The golden wave continues to rush forwards, but begins to turn off-course, some looking towards the sound of the flaring engines, the others ripping at the metal storage bins of synthetic meat. Their assault becomes confused, only a fraction actually reaching the cargo bay doors, where Kuon dispenses of them with relative ease. 
The doors ratchet shut as the ship blasts upwards. The horde regarding the ship eyelessly as they prowl over the jettisoned food.
-> END

==Tank_Escape==
You lock down the portholes of your ship and route all available power to your shields. The number of golden monsters rush out the blast doors even while the first wave strikes the side of your ship. 
They begin to push their heads and claws through the electric blue of your shields, their pure weight causing the shields to buckle. Claws reach your ship and rip backwards, disabling the forcefield in that vicinity. The creatures begin rapidly tearing apart your ship, trying to reach a hallway or room. 
The forcefield blips out of existence as your engines recieve all power and the ship blasts upwards, fragments of hull tumbling off its sides. The massive crowd stares eyelessly as your ship departs.
