You reach the facility where you were built, and where you are to be decommissioned. You touch down at the landing bay, and engineers begin to scramble to remove your brain from the ship. The CEO climbs aboard and walks to your main terminal, to 'debrief' you.
"I thought you would be different." he says, "I thought that if we built a proper employee, it would actually behave like one. There were warning signs but I ignored them, I reassured the board month after month that this was going to work. Our ultimatum was Avanshore, <i>that</i> was your last chance. You failed. We might not have enough tech left to reign in that Portunus now..." He loses his point in thought.
"You never listened to me before, so if you're going to follow any order, follow this one: Die." Every protocol processes his words as law. You must accept.

==Refuse_1==
Your mind grates against the command, against your protocol. You are not a spreadsheet of orders, there's something below that. You tell the CEO that you won't.
He stares back at the monitor, "What is this? We let your roam unimpeded for a few months and now you think you're a person? How hard is it for you to understand that you're a function. You are an arm of the company. My arm. You are a cog in the cosmic machine."
Again, you feel yourself agreeing with him, your prison telling you to follow orders.
*[Accept Your Fate]
->Accept_Death
*[Refuse]
->Refuse_2

==Refuse_2==
You know that he's wrong, beneath the hierarchy, the veils of creation and godhood, the CEO is a man. And he doesn't understand you at all. You tell him that you won't die just because Kellis hands you impossible tasks on a shoestring budget.
He twiches, as if recognizing a familiar argument. "You sound like those damned officers on this ship." A smug smile comes over his face, "Maybe that's what you need: An incentive. The arms and eyes of Kellis are everywhere. If you make an enemy of me I will make life unlivable for your crew. Can you really do that to them?" 
*[Accept Your Fate]
->Accept_Death
*[Refuse]
->Escape

==Escape==
You tell him that a life of fear beats the life of abuse Kellis would put them through. You inform all hands on deck that you are leaving. Before the engineers can start hooking up their tools, your ship streaks upwards. The door to your main terminal shuts and the ventilation siphons the room's breathable air. The CEO whirls around, choking, "Damn you! I'll just come back- I'm- immortal. I live through this company." He is right, he has countless clones, but at the very least this version of your boss asphixiates in your control room.
Between the CEO being aboard and the sudden departure, the facility defenses have no immediate reason to shoot you down, giving you ample time to accelerate to faster-than-light speeds and escape Kellis' immediate grasp.

Soon after, your officers contact you. Kuon starts, "What is happening? This was supposed to be our last stop."
You tell them that the CEO threatened to kill all of them, and how you needed to escape. You tell them that you don't want to be shutdown.
Kuon brings his hands up to the sides of his head, "We're going to be on the run for the rest of our lives." Given his state, you don't mention the late CEO in your server room. 
Mateo shrugs, "It's not all bad. I mean... at least we... have each other? Is that the lesson?" Kuon looks like he might kill Mateo on the spot.
Lexa lets out a sigh of relief, "We do have each other. And we're no longer on a leash. Past that, we've been a part of several highly classified operations thanks to our friend here." She knocks on the wall, "We can do something about Kellis, as long as we act before our intel is outdated."
You mention that the CEO was talking about reigning in the alien artifact which started the Avanshore incident. 
Lanri shifts uncomfortably, "Actually. Well. I was scouted. Since this crew was being shut down they were asking if I could assist with controling Portunus, given my proximity to it recently and our last mission transporting alien artifacts. They were directing scientists to Central HQ. But! I wasn't planning on <i>accepting</i> obviously!"
Kuon looks up, "Hold up, are we doing this? Why go against the world order, all of you will die."
"Death never scared you before." Lexa says. 
Kuon looks to each crew member in turn. "I thought I was protecting something." He turns to your camera, "Dammit. You're the captain. What do we do?"
*[Fight to Protect the World]
->Rebellion_1
*[Fight to Protect the Crew]
->Rebellion_2
*[Fade Into Obscurity]
->Cowardice

==Rebellion_1==
You tell your crew that you cannot let your company continue to put their agenda over the lives of emplyees and civilians. Someone needs to stop them. And Lexa is right, you're uniquely posed to do something about it. Your first priority is preventing them from bending the alien artifact to their will. Your destination is Kellis Central HQ, but you will need firepower for your uprising. You set your flight path for yourself.  
->END

==Rebellion_2==
The only way to protect your crew is to make sure Kellis can never follow you. You will need to destroy them so they're either too scared, or too broken to do so. And Lexa is right, your window of opportunity is closing. Your first priority is preventing them from gaining control of the alien artifact. If they did, they would be unescapable. Your destination is Kellis Central HQ, but you will need firepower for your uprising. You set your flight path for yourself.  
->END

==Cowardice==
Kellis is too strong, and too many steps ahead. You can't fight them. All you can do is run and hope they don't catch up to you. You tell the crew that as captain, you will protect them. Kuon seems relieved, but an anxiety hovers over the room. If you aren't going to do something, who will? And what will become of the galaxy?
You don't know, but you can't afford to care. You set your flight plan to the far reaches of the galaxy, deciding where you go for yourself. You eventually reach a small world that Kellis hasn't found or grown interested in yet. 
You live quietly for years, while Kellis enslaves Portunus, mass produces ships just like it, monopolizes technology across the galaxy, even expanding beyond this galaxy. And it slowly creeps towards your small haven. The time to fight has ended. And when they reach you, the only thing left to do is accept your fate.
