You touch down the facility where you were built, and where you are to be decommissioned. Engineers begin to scramble to remove your “brain” from the ship while the CEO walks to your main terminal, to 'debrief' you.
"I thought you would be different." he says, "I thought that if we built a proper employee, it would actually behave like one. There were warning signs but I convinced the board to overlook them. Our ultimatum was Avanshore, <i>that</i> was your last chance. Yet you and your crew kept rebelling against us.
"Don't you get it? You are an arm of the company. You are a cog in my cosmic machine. Stop acting like you're anything else and die. It's your last order; try following it." He touches an earpiece, "Round up the crew, we're done with them."

==Accept_Death==
You know the CEO is right. You were never anything more than the job they designed you for. The CEO leaves, satisfied with your silence. As engineers hook up their tools to the ship and shut down its functions, you try to get used to the idea of going to sleep forever. An endless silence.
There are sounds though, sounds of struggle. You hear a gunshot. Shouting. Suddenly the ship is taking off. Your sensors reactivate and you see Lexa piloting the ship upwards, out of Kellis' grasp, Kuon barely inside the cargo hold, blood on his hands.
You rouse yourself from your near-death state.
Kuon contacts you and the rest of the officers, "They were going to kill us." He breathes, "And now we're going to be on the run for the rest of our lives…”

==Escape==
Your mind grates against the command, but you know you are more than a function. You inform all hands on deck that you’re leaving. Before the engineers can start hooking up their tools, your ship streaks upwards and out of Kellis' grasp. The door to your main terminal shuts and the ventilation siphons the room's breathable air. The CEO curses at you and asphyxiates, but you know another clone will take his place.
Your officers contact you. Kuon starts, "What is happening? This was supposed to be our last stop."
You tell them that the company was going to dispose of you and them.
Kuon brings his hands up to the sides of his head, "Then we're going to be on the run for the rest of our lives..."

==Scene_2==
Mateo shrugs, "It's not all bad. I mean... at least we... have each other? Is that the lesson?" Kuon looks like he might kill Mateo on the spot.
Lexa lets out a sigh of relief, "We do have each other. And we're no longer on a leash. Past that, we've been a part of several highly classified operations thanks to our friend here." She knocks on the wall. "We can do something about Kellis, but  we have to act before our intel becomes outdated."
Lanri shifts uncomfortably, "Actually. Well. I was scouted. Since this crew was being shut down they were asking if I could assist with controlling Portunus, given my recent proximity to it and our last mission transporting alien artifacts. They were directing scientists to Central HQ. But! I wasn't planning on <i>accepting</i> obviously!"
“Central HQ is our target then,” Lexa says.
Kuon looks up, "Hold up, are we doing this? Why go against the world order? All of you will die."
"Death never scared you before." Lexa says.
Kuon looks to each crew member in turn. "I thought I was protecting something." He turns to your camera, "Dammit. You're still the captain. What do we do?"

->Rebellion_2

==Rebellion_1==
You tell your crew that you cannot let your former company continue to put their agenda over the lives of employees and civilians. Someone needs to stop them. And Lexa is right; you are uniquely posed to do something about it. Your first priority is preventing them from bending Portunus to their will. Your destination is Kellis Central HQ, but you will need firepower for your uprising. For the first time, you set your flight path for yourself.  
->END

==Rebellion_2==
The only way to protect your crew is to make sure Kellis can never follow you. You will need to wound them so they're either too scared or too broken to do so. And Lexa is right; your window of opportunity is closing. Your first priority is preventing them from gaining control of Portunus. If they did, they would be inescapable. Your destination is Kellis Central HQ, but you will need firepower for your uprising. For the first time, you set your flight path for yourself.
