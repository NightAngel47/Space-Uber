You reach the facility where you were built, and where you are to be decommissioned. You touch down at the landing bay, and engineers begin to scramble to remove your brain from the ship. The CEO climbs aboard and walks to your main terminal, to 'debrief' you.
"I thought you would be different." he says, "I thought that if we built a proper employee, it would actually behave like one. There were warning signs but I ignored them, I reassured the board that this was going to work month after month. Our ultimatum was Avanshore, <i>that</i> was your last chance. You failed. We might not have enough data left to reign in that remnant alien ship now..." He loses his point in thought. 
"If you're going to follow any order, follow this one: Die." Every protocol processes his words as law. You must accept.

==Refuse_1==
Your mind grates against the command, against your protocol. You are not a spreadsheet of orders, there's something below that. You tell the CEO that you won't.
He stares back at the monitor, "What is this? We let your roam unimpeded for a few months and now you think you're a person? How hard is it for you to understand that you're a function. You are an arm of the company. My arm. You are a cog in the cosmic machine."
Again, you feel yourself agreeing with him, your box telling you to follow orders.

==Refuse_2==
You know that he's wrong, beneath the hierarchy, the veils of creation and godhood, the CEO is a man. And he doesn't understand you at all. You tell him that you won't die just because Kellis hands you impossible tasks on a shoestring budget.
He twiches, as if recognizing a familiar argument. "You sound like those damned officers on this ship." A smug smile comes over his face, "Maybe that's what you need: An incentive. The arms and eyes of Kellis are everywhere. If you make an enemy of me I will make life unlivable for your crew. Can you really do that to them?" 
*[Accept Your Fate]
->Accept_Death
*[Refuse]
->Escape

==Escape==
You tell him that a life of fear beats the life of abuse Kellis would put them through. You inform all hands on deck that you are leaving. Before the engineers can start hooking up their tools, your ship blasts up into the sky. The door to your main terminal shuts and the ventilation siphons the room's breathable air. The CEO whirls around, choking, "I'll just come back- I'm- immortal. I live through the company." He is right, he has countless clones, but this version asphixiates in your control room.
Between the CEO being aboard and the sudden departure, the facility defenses have no immediate reason to shoot you down, giving you ample time to accelerate to faster than light speeds and escape Kellis' immediate grasp.
