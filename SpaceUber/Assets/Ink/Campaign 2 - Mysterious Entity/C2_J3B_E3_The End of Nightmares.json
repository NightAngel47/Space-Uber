Knowing exactly which one he is talking about; you ask him why. \"I don't know. I swear I hear whispers when I'm near it.

Plus, none of the attempts have focused on it.","\n","^\"I know I spoke against examining it earlier, but I think you need to do something before something really bad happens.

Your hunch is proved correct when, instead of protesting their sudden confinement, the crew members simply continue their efforts to leave. Kuon, remaining ever vigilant, continues standing guard even as you alert him about what is happening.","\n","^However, there is a problem. While Lexa, Ripley, Lanri, and Mateo should be fine in their private cabins, those in the communal bunkrooms might hurt each other as they push against the door.","\n","^Although it would be hard for Kuon to do, it might be best to let him deal with them. During the previous attempts, the crew members have shown no hostility towards Kuon even as he subdued them, as they seem to single-minded in their focus of damaging the various relics.

Your crew is scratched and bruised, and a few members will have to have medical care, but there are no life-threatening injuries.

Instead of slowly making their way towards the various crates as they had previously, they start rushing towards Kuon. Startled as one goes to take a swing at him, he barely ducks the blow. Recovering quickly, he stuns them with his sidearm, sending them falling to the floor.","\n","^As more and more rush in, things just get worse. Although he tries to stun most members, sometimes he has to resort to sharp blows to the legs or arms to defend himself, breaking several limbs and bones.","\n","^The worst moment comes at the end. His sidearm out of ammo, he shoots the last two with his spare. As they fall to the floor, the red puddle expanding beneath them shows he forgot to set the other firearms to stun. Beside the corpses, the rest of your crew (excepting the ones locked in their cabins) lie unconscious, some with arms and legs unnaturally bent and broken.","\n","^You make your delivery, and although most of your crew is alright, they have started to resent you, as a few of them have been taken to either medical or the mortuary, and the rest feel the aches and pains of what has happened. Kuon also feels horrible about what has happened, even though he solely blames himself.","\n","^As you deliver your cargo, Kellis is pleased, not caring about what has happened to your crew members.

I know it. This is what's causing all of this.\" He starts drawing his sidearm before you order him to stop, telling him that we need to think this through before acting.","\n","^You could have him blast it. If he's right, it might be worth angering Kellis slightly to be able to deliver the relics safely. Even if he's wrong, you can simply feign ignorance as to what happened to the artifact.","\n","^You could also drop the obelisk off somewhere for safe keeping. There are likely several abandoned space stations, as it's cheaper to just let an obsolete facility become a piece of space junk floating in the void than properly disposing of it.

Kuon sinks to the ground and passes out from exhaustion.","\n","^Observing your sleeping crew members, you note that they are sleeping soundly, instead of appearing tossing and turning in their beds. As they wake up they appear well rested. You order a few of them to go to the cargo hold and do as you say without asking too many questions.","\n","^You have several take Kuon back to his cabin, where your security chief gets a well-deserved rest. The rest place the obelisk back into its container after disposing of the pieces that broke off of it.","\n","^Delivering the artifact, you let your crew, now in good spirits, take a much-deserved break.
