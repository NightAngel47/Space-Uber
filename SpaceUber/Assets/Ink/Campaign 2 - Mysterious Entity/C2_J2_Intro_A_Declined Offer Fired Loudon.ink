Having left the pit stop, you continue to transport Kellis' priceless antiques to their awaiting hands. With the tales of a curse and the strange goings-on exposed as nothing more than a pathetic attempt to acquire the Keystone, the crew should be relaxed during the rest of the trip.
However, Ripley has started getting reports of sleepless nights and horrific nightmares from various crew members. Despite the curse having been revealed as a fake, whispers that the artifacts are the cause have started to spread again. You'll have to keep an eye on them and make sure morale doesn't get too low.
