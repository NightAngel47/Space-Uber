Siding with Ripley has alleviated some of the tension, as you chose to acknowledge the concern of your crew over the orders of your bosses. Furthermore, according to Ripley, the crew is sleeping significantly better and the nightmares have subsided.","\n","^Caution should still be taken, however. While the nightmares are gone, it has been replaced with a cacophony of whispering and murmuring inside the cargo hold. Most of the speech is muddled, indistinct. The few clear words that can be made out haven't been recognized by you or anyone else onboard. They appear to belong to no language known to mankind. Your crew, minus Lanri, have made it a point to stay away from the cargo hold.","\n","^Speaking of Lanri, she has run a large variety of tests on the artifact since it has been opened, none have borne fruit. Attempts to translate the artifact's text have failed. There is no trace of a signal or of radiation that could have been the source of the nightmares. And she can come up with no logical explanation for the various sounds within the walls of the hold.","\n","end",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
