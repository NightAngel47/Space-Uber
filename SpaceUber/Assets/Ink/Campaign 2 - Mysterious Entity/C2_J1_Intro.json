{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^You have been given the job of transporting a large shipment of alien artifacts. As they represent the knowledge and culture of a dead civilization, Kellis wants them delivered safe and sound.","\n","^This job should go as smoothly as any other routine cargo transportation and delivery.  That being said,  Kellis has made it clear that one of the biggest and most valuable relics, christened the Keystone by the dig team due to its importance, is to stay within its cargo container no matter what. It is not to be moved or opened under threat of having your pay docked.","\n","^The orders can be explained by not only the value of the Keystone, but also by the fact that there were several incidents during the excavation. Over the course of the dig, arguments became more and more common, the members squabbling over petty issues and pointless trifles, culminating in an accident that left one of the archeologists dead.","\n","^From what you've read, Kellis may also be weary of rivals such as Equinox, as the whole project has received little publicity for such momentous findings. You may have to keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.","\n","end",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
