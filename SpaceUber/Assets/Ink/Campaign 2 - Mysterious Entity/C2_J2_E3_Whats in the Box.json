Lanri and Mateo are becoming nervous wrecks. Lexa won't even leave her cabin. A lot of the crew keep saying a strange statue is to blame. I've seen it as well...","\n","^\"When I close my eyes, I see the dead and dying...and that thing. I think it is the cargo container that Kellis told you to keep locked...the one Equinox wanted. I'm starting to believe what Loudon said. Despite your orders, I think it needs to be opened and checked on. Maybe there is some sort of... I don't know, radiation or something coming off it and causing these nightmares. Please. Just to see if we can make the dreams stop.\"","\n","^As she finishes her pleading, Kuon makes his presence known. \"I must object. We are under explicit orders not to open the container. I know the crew is suffering. I've had to put with bad dreams every night for several years, so I understand. But I've pushed on, and they need to learn to do so as well. Pissing off our superiors isn't going to do anyone any favors.\"","\n","^Falling silent, Kuon stands there awaiting a response. Ripley doesn't speak up again as well.
