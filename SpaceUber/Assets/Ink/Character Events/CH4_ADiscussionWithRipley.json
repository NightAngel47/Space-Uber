When you patch into the cameras your gaze immediately falls upon the closed body bag lying on an examination table. Ripley appears from behind one of the many medical curtains littered throughout the Medbay. She thanks you for coming, and says that she would like you to weigh in on something she has had trouble finding a proper solution to. However, first, she asks the all-important question: “Are you capable of feeling or understanding human emotions?
