Kuon pauses, as if this is the first time he had ever taken his own thoughts into consideration. Finally, he breaks the silence, “Thank you for such wisdom, I’ll be sure to keep it in mind. Just remember, you can always count on me.” He gives a slight nod before he departs, leaving you alone.

“Forgive my impudence, but I’d have to disagree. I won’t say that I’ve been doing my absolute best, and for that I apologize.
