“Only good enough, not quite great. I’ll make a note of that.”

Kuon pauses, as if this is the first time he had ever taken his own thoughts into consideration. Finally, he breaks the silence, “Thank you for such wisdom, I’ll be sure to keep it in mind. Just remember, you can always count on me.” He gives a slight nod before he departs, leaving you alone.
