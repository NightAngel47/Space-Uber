"Only good enough, not quite great. I'll make a note of that."
He shakes his head back and forth, "Regardless, I could be doing a better job, right? No matter what, I could always do more."

Kuon pauses, as if this is the first time he had ever taken his own thoughts into consideration. Finally, he breaks the silence, "Thank you for such wisdom, I'll be sure to keep it in mind. Just remember, you can always count on me." He gives a slight nod before he departs.

"Forgive my impudence, but I'd have to disagree. I won't say that I've been doing my absolute best, and for that I apologize. However, and maybe this is just me, but I'd like to think that I do important work on this ship."
