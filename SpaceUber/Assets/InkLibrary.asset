      leave the bay doors to your ship closed. The clones are gathered with their
      mercenaries, pointing rifles at your ship, waiting for sight of their originals.\",\"\\n\",\"^The
      ringleaders of this conspiracy, the clones of Beckett and Whitwer, step forward.
      Olivia Two calls out to you, \\\"Well, we have been expecting you. Are they
      all in the loading bay?\\\" Although your affirmative reply pleases her, Beckett
      Two is getting impatient, \\\"Well, what the fuck are you waiting for? Open
      those doors so we can kill those bastards!\\\" You give the signal.\",\"\\n\",\"^The
      bay doors snap open, and a hail of fire bursts forth from the opening. In seconds
      most of the clones are dead, having energy blasts burn through their vital
      organs or melt their heads like candles. A few manage to get shots off before
      they are slaughtered.\",\"\\n\",\"^You commend the security crew you had stationed
      in the bay on their quick reflexes and true aim. You will have to fix the damage
      the stray shots had done to your hull, as well as replace the unfortunate crewman
      who had his face liquidized by a plasma blast.\",\"\\n\",\"^Having the rest
      of your crew gather the bodies, you start to head back to where the elites
      are vacationing. Seeing as Whitwer had seemed to act as a leader of the group,
      you send her a video of the clones: Them awaiting you, Beckett Two's vile intentions,
      and their subsequent demise at the hands of your personnel.\",\"\\n\",\"^You
      tell her that the Kellis corporation had better receive rather generous payments,
      or you would release some rather unsavory facts: Autopsy reports showed that
      many of the clones had cybernetics replacements for their organs, as if someone
      had been harvesting them for years. You also have recordings of the charity
      auction, including a highlights reel of many of the illicit items that were
      up for bidding.\",\"\\n\",\"^A few hours later, you receive a communication
      from the resort. Whitwer, representing the group of elites, keeps a calm facade
      as she speaks, although it is clear she is seething below the surface: \\\"After
      discussing the facts, we have agreed to meet your terms. Not only will you
      receive the promised amount for taking us to our destination, but we will also
      include a bonus you will find quite generous. In exchange, you will erase those
      regrettable recordings.\\\"\",\"\\n\",\"^The facade she is putting on drops,
      and she glares at the camera with contempt, \\\"I know you were working with
      the clones, you just backstabbed them out of convenience, so do not think this
      is over. You and your crew better watch your backs because we have money, power,
      and most importantly, connections. One day you will pay for your treachery.\\\"
      With that, the transmission ends.\",\"\\n\",\"end\",{\"#f\":1}],\"Trap\":[[\"^You
      decide to take the elites to their final destination. As you approach the coordinates
      given to you by the clones, you have security round up the elites at gunpoint.
      Although they outnumber your security crew, they hesitate to act considering
      they are unarmed. They are brought to the loading bay to await touchdown. Having
      been grouped together by your security, you notice they are starting to whisper
      among themselves.\",\"\\n\",\"^All of a sudden, Whitwer shouts, \\\"Now!\\\"
      Chaos breaks out as the several elites pull blades and guns from their vests,
      rushing your security team. Weapons start going off, and several of your crew
      go down under the assault of the VIPs. You have to give orders quickly, before
      you fully lose control of the situation. You get the sense that the clones
      wanted to be the ones to kill their originals, but taking prisoners in a battle
      like this would be costly.\",\"\\n\",\"ev\",\"str\",\"^Subdue Them\",\"/str\",\"/ev\",{\"*\":\".^.c-0\",\"flg\":4},\"ev\",\"str\",\"^Take

      send out the order to avoid using lethal force no matter the cost. The element
      of surprise wearing off, security crew acts swiftly, switching their weapons
      to stun. Shots start ringing out and bodies start hitting the floor.\",\"\\n\",\"^Once
      the last of the elites is down for the count, you request a status update of
      both parties. While most of the elites lay unconscious, several of them are
      laying in pools of blood, as some of your security had acted before you gave
      orders. Among the prone figures are several dead crew members, having been
      beaten and shot by your frenzied clients. The precious seconds it took to switch
      from kill to stun turned out to be critical.\",\"\\n\",\"^As you land at the
      dock, you prepare the remaining elites, their hands bound, to be marched out.
      Those who perished in the preceding events have been unceremoniously stuffed
      into a spare cargo container, which you will present alongside their breathing
      brethren.\",\"\\n\",\"^The clones are waiting in a group, flanked by metal-clad
      mercenaries, most pointing weapons towards the bay doors in preparation for
      the originals. Whitwer and Beckett's clones step forward. Olive Two speaks: 
      \\\"Well, we've been expecting you. Are they all in the loading bay?\\\" You
      reply in the affirmative but tell them about the trouble you've had.\",\"\\n\",\"^Beckett
      Two seems annoyed: \\\"What the fuck does that matter! March them out here
      so we can have our fun!\\\"  However, Olivia's clone seems to have other ideas,
      turning to the other clones, she gets their attention. As a sadistic smirk
      crosses her face, she speaks, \\\"We wished to get retribution for the years
      of servitude and pain our originals put us through, right? What better way
      to get our revenge than to make them take our place? Let\u2019s see how they
      like being used as spare parts.\\\"\",\"\\n\",\"^She lays out a plan in which
      they would take the place of the originals, and their templates would take
      their place as servants and organ banks. Once more speaking to you, she speaks
      \\\"Thank you for all you have done. You will find that your reward will be
      a king's ransom. All that is left is to release the 'clones' into our custody.\\\"
      You open the bay doors and have security lead out the prisoners, as well as
      the container holding the slaughtered members.\",\"\\n\",\"^The clones take
      over command of them, and you have security withdraw. As you get ready to leave,
      your sensors pick up Whitwer's clone standing above her now-kneeling original.
      Right before liftoff, you hear her gloat, \\\"I'm in charge now. Isn't that
      right, Oliva Two?\\\"\",\"\\n\",\"end\",{\"#f\":1}],\"Kill\":[\"^Not wanting
      to risk the lives of your security team, you order them to open fire. The elites
      are quickly cut down. Energy weapons melt through tissue, fusing clothing to
      flesh and leaving vital organs charred to a crisp. Once the last elite meets
      their grisly demise, you take stock of the situation. While a few of the crew
      members are heavily injured, they will survive. You have the bodies gathered
      and thrown into a spare cargo container.\",\"\\n\",\"^You touch down at the
      coordinates given to you. The clones are waiting in a group, most pointing
      weapons towards the bay doors in preparation for the originals. Whitwer and
      Beckett's clones step forward. Olivia Two speaks, \\\"Well, we have been expecting
      you. Are they all in the loading bay?\\\" You reply in the affirmative but
      tell them about the trouble you've had.\",\"\\n\",\"^Most of the group seems
      displeased at the news. Beckett Two screams, \\\"You fucker! How dare you take
      away our chance to extract our pound of flesh from them!\\\" While also unhappy
      at the news, Whitwer's clone, more level-headed than her screaming partner,
      speaks to the group, \\\"I know we wished to be the ones to exact vengeance,
      but this doesn't change the fact that they are dead, leaving us in charge.\\\"\",\"\\n\",\"^Speaking
      to you again, she continues, \\\"You ignored our request for this last group
      coming in alive, but you still helped to secure our freedom. While I can't
      promise that the others will pay you generously for your help, I can assure
      you I will.\\\"\",\"\\n\",\"^Leaving the bodies in their custody, you depart.
      A few days later a good amount of credits are deposited in your account. The
      sum is slightly larger than what the originals had promised you for doing your
      job, although the costs from complying with the clones' demands might not have
      been worth the extra revenue.\",\"\\n\",\"end\",{\"#f\":1}],\"#f\":1}],\"listDefs\":{}}"
