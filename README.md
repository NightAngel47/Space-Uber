![Build](https://github.com/NightAngel47/Space-Uber/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

## Coding Guidelines
	
  Naming conventions for scripts are based on this link: 
  [raywenderlich/c-sharp-style-guide: C# Style Guide for Unity Tutorials](https://github.com/raywenderlich/c-sharp-style-guide)   
  The last 3 sections don’t apply. I also don’t care about line length, just make it readable.
